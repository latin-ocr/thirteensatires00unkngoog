neither love nor be beloved by any.'' He asks the heaviest curse that
could be inflicted on the man for his meanness: a long, dreary life
with heaps of stolen gold to look at, and not a friend in the whole
world with whom to exchange sympathy.

SATIRE XIII,

A rmmm of J uvenal’s, whom he calls Calvinus, is in a state of great
excitement about a fraud practised upon him by one to whom he had
given in trust a sum of money, and who had denied the trust on oath.
Juvenal writes to him ridiculing his wrath as mean and unphilosophi·
cal. The satire takes the form ot' expostulation and ironical consolation
throughout. Itis most familiar! y known as dealing with the subject of
an accusing conscience, which it does in a very wei-ful way. But this
is only one part of the whole. The character o the times and the con-
trast os the past and the present occupy much of the poem, and 'there-is

of innocence. There is no need of the supposition that J uvenal derived
the ideas of this satire from the doctrines of Christianity. There never
was a time when conscienoe did not exist in the mind of man, however
completely the habit of guilt may have seared it in some and have
given a color of innoc-enos to wickedness in the udgment of whole
communities. What 0] uvenal says on the subject o' conscience derives
its only weight from its truth; and though he exaggerates when he
leads to the inserence that the stings ot a guilty conscience must nec-
essarily follow guilt, the picture he draws is taken from experience,
not from revelation, the experience of those who were no Chris-
tians and had no knowledge to frighten them but that which was
suggested from within. The soliloquy in which a man argues away
the misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the denial
of it, represents no doubt the conduct and feelings of many who
have more light than that of conscience3 but there too the man
is not a bad Christian, but a bad pagam and if we are surprised
to read in Juvenal language or sentiments which if delivered from a
Christian pulpit would be appropriate and searching. it is because wc
are apt to forget that human nature, with its desires, its corruptions,
and its sels-deceptione, has always been the same in the main, and that
God has never been without his witness against guilt in the heart of man.
The reader had better take up this satire as representing the common
moral sense of mankind, and look to the law of Christianity as confirm-
ing the unwritten law of which conscience has always been the guar-
dian and the exponent. and of which such writings as J uvenal’S, espe-
cially this poem, are the clearest evidence. From v. 17 it is commonly
infel-red that the poem was writteili4in Hadrian’s reign, about au. 119.
