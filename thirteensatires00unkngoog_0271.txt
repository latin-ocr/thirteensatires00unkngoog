Latin. By D. Y. Consi-oon, M A., Phillips Academy‚ Andover,

John S. white, LL.D., Head-Master Berkeley School, New York City. —
Comstock's Latin Book 1 find the best book for its purpose that 1 have ever
used. The review of English Grammar at the beginning; the separation
of the vocabularies from the exereises3 judicious and progressive presen-
tation of the various uses of the verb in the different moodsg and the con·
densed exhibit of the grammar, —are such valuable features gathered
within the covers of a text-book, that it has no rival.

Nathan Thompson, A.M., Principal Lawrence Academy, Groton, Mass.
—It is altogether the best Latin book for beginners with which 1 am
acquainted.

Qec. B. Turnbul, Golqate Λατώ, Hamilton, N. Y. —1 am using Com-
stock’s First Latin Book with the Junior Class, and find it even more
satisfactory than 1 had hoped. ‘

Prof. E. Alexander, University of Tennessee, Knoxville.—Comstock’s
Latin Book is in use in our preparatory department, and is perfectly
satisfactory. A better text-book is not often seen.

Peos. H. C. Missimer, Hiyh school, Eric, Pa.—1t is very easy to see
that Comstock's First Latin Book is the work of a thorough toacher,
who has had actual experience in the class-room with the difficulties which
beginners in Latin usually meet. Its classification and methods are thor·
ough and complete3 its language is clear and simple. Mr. Comstock has
hit the nail on the head. He knows Just what and just how much grammar
is needed for good, clean work. We have had Leighton and Jones, -both
good, - but we like Comstock more, because it is better.

Horace. With English Notas, by the Rev. A. J. MAGLEANE,
Μ.Α. Revised and edited by R. H. Cluen, A.M. Thirteenth
Edition. 12mo, 580 pagos, 8130.

Chas. P. Par-ker, Harvard Colleqe. - Chase's Macleane’s Horace 1 have
long known and used, and have found it thoroughly satisfactory both in
study and in teaching.

Prof. Hei-bert W. Smyth, Williams Colleye, Musa—I am glad to
express my commendation of Macleane’s Horace as republished by you.
Its scholarly character places it at the head of all editions used in schools,
while its just discrimination in the selection of notes adds materially to its
mesulness.

Prot. J. H. chamberlin, Mau-iectu, onio. -1 recommend Macleane’s
Horace to my classes. It is a most excellent edition.
