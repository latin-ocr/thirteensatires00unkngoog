SATIRE 111.

Tms is one of the best known of J uvenal's Satires. English
readers are familiar with Johnson’s imitation of it. We do not know
any thing of Umbricius, unless he is the haruspex of whom Tacitus
says that he warned Galba os his fate. Neither can we determine when
the satire was written ; but it cannot well be placed before a ι). 110.

Aaomumr. — At his departure for Cumae (1-20). Umbricius relates
to Juvenal the causes which have driven him from Rome. There is no
room for honest men, where they only thrive who will make black white
and embrace the meunest employment for gain ; he who cannot lie, who
will not lay the game of parricides‚ adulterers, oppressors‚ is a use-

constant risk of fires or falling houses; but the rich man does not
care for these things (190-231). The noise of the crowded streets
makes sleep impossible for the poor (232-238). The rich man is
borne through the streete in a litter; the poor man is hustled by the
crowds. A client is crushed to death by a load osmarble5 and while
his household is making ready to receive him, he cowers on the shores
