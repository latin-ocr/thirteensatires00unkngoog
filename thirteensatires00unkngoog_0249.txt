212. meliorem praesto mayistro] ‘ Praesto ' is ⁸ 1 warrant,’ and ‘ fore’
may be supplied after ‘ meliorem! He says to the father he need not
bein a hurry; he may go away and make himself easy3 his son is
certain to turn out a good scholar and surpass his teacher as far as
· Ajax surpassed his father Telamon, and Achilles l'eleus. He adds
sarcastically‚ “ you must not press the young mind ; his marrow is not
yet thoroughly saturated with the atrocities of matured vice; when he
comes to man's estate he will be ripe for all that is wicked.’' The ex-

220. Elaeam jam crede namna] “ Yon may consider your ³daughter-
in-law as good as dead and buried is she brings your son a large por·
tion.’' Except under special agreement before marriage the wn'e's
‘dos’ went back to her relations at her death. Here the man must
secure an interest in the pro erty at his wife's death, or it would be

almost see the man clutching his wife’s throat.

225. Mandavi,] ‘Man-dare' is used here like ‘ tra-dere ' for teaching
(see above, verse 3, n.).

228. pueros producit avaros] ‘ Producere ’ is here to educate. The
change of tense from ‘praecepit' should be observed‚ as denoting a
course of training on a principle once laid down. The next line is
omitted in some MSS„ but not in the best. It has no grammatical
connection with the sentence; either therefore another line has been
lost or this is the work of an interpolator who forgot to finish the mis·
chief he had begun. The language in 230, sqq„ is taken, as is manifest,
from the chariot races.

231. quera si revoces] The antecedent to ‘quem ³ is easily supplied
by substitutlng ‘ juveni' for ‘curriculo' The chariot represents the
son, who is the real subject of the sentence. So immediately below
(verse 241) for an antecedent to ‘ quorum,’ ‘ Thebanos ' must be sub-
stituted for ‘ Thebas.' which is the same thing, as ‘ civitas ' is equiva-
lent sometimes to ⁴ cives,’ πόλις to πολῖται, and so forth. The change
of personia ‘ revoces ’ onl makes the sentence more pointed. ‘ Nes-
cit is used as Horace an others use ‘ nescius! ‘ Revoces ’ is in the
subjunctive of a general condition,- A. 59, 5, a. ‘ Permittas ' is the
subjunctive by attraction; A. 66, 2. Neither construction is unusual.

234. adeo indulyent sibi latius ipsi] ‘ Adeo’ belongs to ‘ indulgent ; '
“ so determined are they to take a wider indulgence without asking
your leave '’ (ipsi). With ‘ stultum ⁹ in the next verse we must supply

esse eum.’

237. et circumscribere] See x. 222. Before ‘ quantus,' ‘ tantus’ must
be supplied. See note on x. 13. As to the Decii, see viii. 254, n.
Menoeceus the son of Creon was said to have sacriflced himself when
Thebes was besieged by the seven chiefs. Teiresias the seer pro·
phesied that if he did so the Thebans would gain the victory. Juvenal
likes a stroke at Greek history (see x. 174) ; he therefore goes out of
his way, and having spoken of Thebes hc adds the legend os Cadmus
