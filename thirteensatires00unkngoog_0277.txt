K ehey's Caesar.

The Illustrations consist of six full-page colored plateS‚ presenting
a vivid and accurate picture of the costumes, equipmentS, weaponS,
and standards of the Roman army; of a double-page map of Gaul,
based upon the latest authoritieS, and showing the route of Caesar in
each campaign3 and of fourteen full-page maps and plans, illustrat·
ing the battles and sieges‚ and placed opposite the text which they
serve to explain. The reproduction of some os these illustrations in
other editions is the best testimonial to their value.

The 'l'ext is clear, accurate, and uniform in its orthography‚ and is

, conveniently divided by brief English summaries,

The Notos are apt and sensible. They contain full references to
the Grammars of Allen & Greenough, Harkness, and Gildersleeve‚

pertinent questions on construction and translation, together with all ,

necessary historic-‘tl and topographical information. The notes on

Books V.-V11. are fuller than in most editions».

The 'l'able of Eletus, not found elsewhere, will enable a teacher
ιο drill his class on those constructions which are most perplexin g to
besshlgzzicabulary, like the notes, has been prepared with the design
of giving the pupil such assistance as he needs, and such knowledge as
he can digest.

Tntoughout the book every estez-t has been made, by
way ot fllusttation and comment, to tendet the study
o! Caesar attractive and usefu1,—a means ot culture
as well as ot disciplme. That the result has been to
produce the best-equtpped edition ot the Gauio War
now betete the public, is well shown by the following·
opinions .·—-

Dr. J. H. Hanson, Coburn Classical Institute, Waterville, Bia—I have
carefully examined it, from titlepage to finis, with the utmost satisfaction.
I see nothing to criticise‚ but everything to commend. It is the ideal
Caesar realized. That it surpasses all its competitors in its introduction,
colored illustratione, and maps and plans must, it seems to me, be the
universal verdict.

Chas. Fish‚ Principal Hz‘yh δὀῙιοοέ, Brumwick, Me. —The book seems to me
to be admirable3 indeed 1 hardly see where it can be bettered. The table of
idioms and phrases is by no means one of its smallest recommendatione.
