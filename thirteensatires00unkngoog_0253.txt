³11„ Sensit Alexander, The story of Alexander’s interview with
Diogenes», and how the ynic asked him not to stand between him
and the sun, is known to every schoolboy. The verbs in verse 314
are in the subjunctive by attraction. The verb of which ‘ hic ’ is the
subject must be supplied in the subjunctive of an indirect question.

325. Nullum numen abest] These words are repeated from x. 365.-
‘In quantum’ means no more than ‘ quantum: it is ‘to whatever
lengths.’ As to Epicurus, see xiii. 123, n. He died about 130 years
after Socrates. The modesty of Socrates’s wants is well known from
the Memorabilia of Xenophon and from the Clouds of Aristophanes,
who made it a matter of ridicule.

321. Sapientia] Nature, which the Stoics professed to follow as their
gulde, never differs from Sa ientia or philosoph ·. See xiii. 20.

322. videor te clamer-et] e says “ perhaps ἶ seem to confine you
by too rigid examples; well, then, mix a little of modern life with
theirs3 go as far as the amount Otho fixed for the census of an eques ;
or if this is not enough, if this makes you frown and pout your lip.
take the worth of two equites or even three; make up a third
400‚000 ;'' ‘ millia' is to be supplied. All this is explained on iii. 154.

aaz-Si nondum implevi memma} ‘ Gremium ’ is so used in vii. 215;
it is the sold of thc toga in whic ι the purse was commonly carried.
Narcissus was the chief favorite of Claudius Caesar. He made a
fortune of more than 100,000‚000 sesterces (about 34,000‚000). lt was
he and not Claudius who ordered the death os Messalina (see x. 839,
n.). Claudius was little more than a cipher in his own court.

 

SATIRE XV.

Tms satire must have been written after Juvenal's residence in Egypt.
Under what circumstances he went to that country there is not suffi-
cient authority for saying with any certainty. In verse 27 there is an
allusion which gives fair ground for supposing that the poem was
written in the reign os Hadrian about Aa). 120 (see note). It turns

Egyptians, with a vivid description of a very savage scene, set off by
some fine lines on the more tendet instincts οἱ human nature, and the
ties of sympathy that unite mankind. It seems as if the story, whether
truc or not, had been repeated to Juvenal and had called up all the
prej udices which a residence among these people had created in his
mind. His power in sketching scenes from real life has been often seen

in the course of these satires. The person to whom the satire is ad-
dressed is unknown.
