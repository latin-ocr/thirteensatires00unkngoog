munnam. — All know, my stiend, what kind of gods Egypt wor-
ships; crocodilea, the ibis, apes, even cats, river-fish‚ and dogs. They
may not eat ouions or sheep, but human fiesh they may. When
Ulysses told such a story, it seemed more incredible than all his other
tales3 but that ot which 1 tell was done publicly not long ago (1-32).
The people of Ombi worship the crocodile; the people of Tentyra

But Egypt was more savage than those who offer human sacrifice.
What could have led this people to their crime'.l No barbarous nation
ever acted so oruelly as this useless cowardly herd (ss-131). Nature

( 2. Cragoditon adorat] Herodotus mentions rticularly the people of
Thebes and those who lived near the lake ocris as worshlppers of
the crocodile‚ while the people of the island Elephantine (near Syene)
did not think it sacred, and even ate the flesh. The town, which after
the time os Ptolemy Philadelphus bore the name Arsinoe, in ancient
times was called the city of crocodilos. Herodotus describes the ibis,
and he says the Egyptians honored it because it destroyed the flying
snakes that came over from Arabia, and it came to be generally be·
lieved that this bird fed upon snakes. But the ibis is not capable of
eating snakes, and this is as fabulous as the winged snakes themselves.
It is supposed the Egyptians reverenced this bird because it came to
the country about the time of the rising of the Nile. It was not a
native of Egypt. There are mummies of the ibis, and it is very
common on Egyptian monuments. Its worship was universal in
Egypt. ‘Adorat' seems to be used comically of that which is repul·
sive, and ‘pavet ⁹ os that which is harmless. -

4. cercopitheci] The cynocephalus or dog-headed ape was sacred to
Thoth, the god of letters, whom the Greeks identified with Hermes.
lle was worshipped in particular at Hermopolis in Middle Egypt. The
cercopithecus was a long-tailed ape (κέρκος, πίθηκος), and such have
been found embalmed.

5. Dimidio vnaqicae resonant] The most remarkable remains of
Thebes on the western side of the Nile are two seated colossal figures.
One is covered with ancient inscriptions cut by visitem, which show it
