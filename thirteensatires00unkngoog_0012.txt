he himself therefore ingenuus. He received the usual
education of a Roman boy and youth. He took the ‘toga
virilis ’ about the beginning of Vespasian’s reign, Am. 703
and, having learnt rhetoric in the schools, he continued
to practise it as a man, not professionally‚ but for his
own amusement, through the reign of Vespasian and the
greater part of Domitian’s, that is till the year Am. 94, in
which year, or the next, he by some means offended Domi-
tian, and was sent by him into Egypt with a military
command, such as civilians osten received during the
Empire. In Aa). 96, Domitian was killed and Nerva
succeeded him. Then‚ or soon asterwards, Juvenal was
allowed to give up his command and return to Rome,
being at the time of his return about forty years of age.
An epigram of Martial proves that he was not altogether in-
dependent or comfortable about this time. Nerva reigned
less than two years, and Trajan succeeded to the empire
Am. 983 and in the early part of his reign, soon aster Aa).

the first in our collection was one), having already recited
them to large audiences. It is not unlikely that some of
these, or parts of them, had been composed in the reign of
Domitian, or even earlier, but that the poet had not ven-
tured to make them public. He continued to write freely
during Trajan’s reign, which ended Aa). 117, when Juvenal
was about sixty, and during the early years of Hadrian’s
reign, that is till about Aa). 120. During this reign he
may have lived in comfort through the liberality of the
emperor, though his household was on a stugal scale, as he
tells na in Satire xi„ from which we learn that he had
property at Tibur. It is not impossible that he may have
lived till the accession of Antoninus Pius, who succeeded
