81. crispi jucunda senectus,] ‘ Cheerffll old Crispus! Vibius Crispus
was an orator often mentioned by Quintilian, who speaks of him in
tex-ms like Juvenal, as “vir ingenii jucundi et elegantis.'’ He was
worth nearly ss‚000,000. On ⁸ liceret, see A. 59, 3, ος Μ. 347, obs. 23
A. Sa S. 261, R. 5. ‘ Vero ' is the ablative ot price or of cause.
⁸ Quoque ’ here and in verse 115 seems to mean ⁸ even!

94. Acilius] This is the father of M’. Acilius Glabrio, who was consul
with Trajan aa). 91, and who was put to death by Domitian, Dion

next verse. As to ‘ Domini,’ see above, verse 71, n. -

96. sed olim] ‘ Olim ’ means here ‘ for some time past? It is a late
use of the word. Cicero would have said ‘jamdudum’

98. fraterculus esse quantis] The Gigantes were sons of Earth,
γηγενεῖς. When a man’sparents were unknown he was referred to the
common mother 3 and, as Casaubon says, those who rose from obscu-
rity to high place were called ⁴ lumbrici,' ‘ worms‚' and by the Greeks
ἔντερα γῆς, ‘ entrails of the earth!

101.. artes Patr-{cias 9] The various arts to which the Patricians had
recourse to save themselves. Glabrio's was that of degrading himself
into a ‘venator,’ which Juvenal compares with the crastiness of 1..
Junius Brutus, who, Livy says, allowed himself to be supposed a fool,
that he might the better watch sor his opportunity of delivering his
country. This trick might pass with Tarquinius Superbus, a king of
the old days when they wore beardo, but was not likely to impose
ggglndmodeErnfyrantts. ἓξιξίΐῃ ιέἰῃέτρὶἰιιςζᾲι the fashion of wearing

105. Rubria-sd Some take this person for Rubrius Gallus, who was
sent by Nero against Galba and deserted him, and supposed that this
was his ‘ ancient offence,' and that Nero is the satire-writer mentioned
in the next line, because he wrote a m on one Clodius Pollio, and
another on Afranius Quintianus. ‘ probior,' Heinrich says, means
‘ more abusive! It implies also that he had no shame.

107. Montani quoque venter] This is like ‘ Crispi senectus ’ above, verse
81. Curtius Montanus, a senator, is repeatedly mentioned by Tacitus.
He was exiled by Nero on a charge of libelling him. He may be the
man spoken of. As to Crispinus, see verse 1 of this Sat-ire. He per·
fuined himself in the morning, a vulgar thing to do, and smelt as
strong as two funerals. A con-pse was commonly smeared with oint·
ment; buming censers were carried in the procession, and perfumes
of all sorts and flowers were thrown upon the funeral pile. The
amomum, from which ‘ mummy ’ is sometimes erroneously said to be
derived, was an Eastern shrub, and therefore by the Latin poets
usually called ‘ Assyrium!

110. ⁴Pompeius] This person is not known. He was a ‘ delator!
