town was Eboracum (York). Tacitus speaks of the Brigantes as
being the largest tribe in Britain. They also occupied the hill-country
of Cumberland and Westmoreland, in which they had probably many
of the ‘ castella ' Juvenal mentions. They gave a good deal of trouble
to Agricola, and it appears they were not quiet when this satire was
written. The date cannot, however, be fixed.

man says to his son “don’t turn up your nose at any kind of wares

to make any difference between persumes and hides.'’ Tanning and
other work of an offensive kind was carried on beyond the river.

204. Lucri bonus est odor The ancients tried metal by the smell.

206. dis atque ipso Jove iqua poetae .·] This way of speaking, where a
general term is followed hy a particular which is involved in it, is very
common in Greek and Latin. It is uncertain what poet Juvenal gets
