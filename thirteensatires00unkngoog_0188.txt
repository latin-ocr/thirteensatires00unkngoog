is another patrician. The name belonged to the Cornelia gens.
This play was celebrated. Laureolus, the principal character, was
crucifled for some delinquency. Josephus says he was a robber.
Juvenal says that the man who acted him, vigorously and even well,
ought to have been hanged in reality.

190. triscureia patrichrumd This word ‘ triscurria ' is not found
elsewhere. The more likely derivation is from ‘scurra,’ and ‘tri-
scurria ’ are buffooneries of the lowest kind, ‘ tri' having, as in
several other words, an intensive meaning. If the word were com-

so called because they wore nothing on their feet. The Mamerci
were a family of the Aemilia ens, tricians.

192 Quanti sua ‚sunem ven unt] e goes on to show how patricians
hired themselves out as gladiatore. In the time of the republic most
of the ‘ludi publici' were under the management of the aediles.
, Under the empire the aediles had inferior functione, and the office feu

into disrepute. The public games and theatrical representatione
were thenceforward managed by the praetore. The praetor sat on
his curule chair, raised above the other seats, and he is therefore
called ‘celsi' ‘Ludis’ is used to denote the time when the sale is
made. M. 276, obs. 2; H. 426, 1.

19⁵. Finye tamen ¹qladios] Suppose this choice were given you of
the sword or the stage, who would hesitate between death and
degradationz ‘ Quid’ is for ‘utrum3’ as in English ‘which ’ has
taken the place of ⁸ whether’ (of two things). Thymele the ‘mima'
has been mentioned before, with her partner Latinus (i. 36).
Zelotypus is the jealous husband in the play, as ‘stupidus' ’m the
blockhead who got knocked about. Corinthus seems to have been
famous in this part. Nothing more is known of him. Nero’s pride
in his musical 'attainments is well known; see below on verse 225.
‘Mimus’ and ‘planipes’ (191) are the same. Unlike the Greeks,
from whom the word is borrowed‚ the Romans gave the name to the
actor as well as to the play.

199. Haec ultra uid erit nisi ludus f] ‘ After this (if we go on in
this wa ) what sh l we have at Rome but shows'l' ‘Ludus' or
‘ res lu icrae ' included theatrical and gladiatorial and all other shows.
⁴ Illud ' refers to what follows, which is an instance. See A. 20, 2, ὁ;
Η. 450, 3; M. 485, b. ‘ Et ' is used to introduce an illustration. The
especial disgrace of the person referred to as Gracchus is, that he
preren-ed fighting as a ‘retiarius ’ whose arms and dress gave him no
disguise, since he wore no helmet or shield, and nothing but a cap ancl
short tunic, so that everybody could see and recognize his face. The
‘ mirmillones ⁹ were also called Galli, being armed like the Gauls with
a helmet, a short sword, and an oblong shield covering the greater
part of their body. ‘ Falce ' means ‘ a short sword ; ’ and ‘supina,'
‘ upturned.’ The ‘retiarius’ threw his net, and, if he failed to
entangle his adversary, caught it up and ran round the Circus,
pursued by the other, till he could get another opportunity of throwing
