to lay waste his native place, is told by Homer (Il. ix.). Virro’s boar
was a worthy companion for this monster. A boar served up whole
was commonly the chief dish (‘caput coenae ’). The fattening of
fowls (altiles) and the livera of geese was carried to perfection by
these Romans. The geese were fattened on flgs. In our day Stras·
bourg has been famous for its prite's de fhies ,9¹'“⁸› some of the livers
weighing as much as three pounds. ‘ Altiles were fattened on grain,
which was sometimes steeped in wine.

116. tradentur tuber-ad ‘ Tubera ⁹ were great delicacies with the Ro-
mans. Whether they were what we know as the ‘ tuber cibarium ’ or
common truffle, has been doubted. They cannot have been very dif-
ferent. They were said to be produced by autumn rains and frequent
thunder3 so the author calls the latter ‘ optata! From this notion the
‘ tuber ' was called ‘ ceraunium! The epicure Allidius is willing that
Libya, the greatest granary of Rome, should give up sending corn
and-furnish only truffles. He is introduced in a parenthesis. On the
subjunctive ‘mittas,’ consult A. 61, 8; Η. 503, 1.; M. 351, b, obs. 2.

120. Structorem] This is the title of the man whose business it
was to arrange (struere) the table. It is also used for the person who
carved the meat, otherwise called ‘ scissor ’ or ⁴ carptor.' The latter is
here meant. It appears that great men in this department carved
with various fantastic movements of the arms and legs, flourishing
their knife about, as here described. These persons were trained
under regular professore. ‘ chironomunta ’ is the Greek participle of

aloud to his scholars that which they had to lea-rn and repeat.

125. faifal? Hercule Cacus] Cacus was a monstrous son of Vulcan,
who stole Hercules's cows, and was beaten to death by him with
stonesdand1 trunks of trees, and dragged out of his cave by the heels
when ea .

127. Hiscere, tanquam habeas] ‘If you ever attempt to open your
mouth, as if you were a man of family and had three names.’ Ro-
man citizens had generally three names: ‘praenomen‚’ which was
given on the ninth day after their birth ; ‘ gentilicium nomen,’ which
indicated the Gens to which they belonged3 and ‘cognomen,' which
was the family name belonging to their branch of the Gens. To these
was sometimes added an honorary name, called ‘agnomen,' derived
from some great action, or other cause, as ‘ Publius Cornelius Scipio
Ali-manus! A slave had only one name, and a freedman took usually
the ‘ praenomen ⁹ and ‘nomen gentilicium ’ of his late master, but not
his ‘ cognomen,' instead of which he sometimes retained his own name
which he had as a slave. On ‘habeas,' see A. 61‚and R.; M. 349 and
obs.; Z. 572.

Quando propinat] The practice of drinking healths was as com-
mon with the Romans as with modern nations. ‘ Bene te,’ or ‘ bene
tibi: was the formula, as in Plautus: ‘⁴ Bene vos Ξ bene nos! bene te!
