254. Plebeiae Deciorum ammae,] The Decii were, as Juvenal says,
a plebeian family, but a very old one, for at the secession of the plebs,
κιο. 494, M. Decius was one of the deputies sent by them to treat

tion with his collea ue, T. Manlius Torquatus, in the Latin War. He
devoted himself to eath in bat-tle, and thereby secured the victory to
the Romans. His son, who had the same name, acted as his father
