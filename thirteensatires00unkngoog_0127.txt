sATmE 1. 111

117. nummus honor] “ The highest magistrates.” ‘ Referre ¹ is the
proper word for entering money in an account book, and ⁴ rationes ⁹
are the accounts themselves.

119. Que‘dsacient concites] That is, those parasites whose profession
it was to wait upon the rich. See above, verse 46.

120. Dmsissima centum Quadrantes] See note on verse 95. ‘Den-
sissima lectica' is equivalent to ‘ plurima lectica! Men are not satis-
fied with going themselves, but they must take their wives with them
to get a double allowance, though they be sick or in the family way.
Another takes his wite’s empty chair‚ with the curtains drawn round.
“ lt's my wife Galla,” says he; ‘⁴ don’t keep a lady waiting.’' “ Show
yourself, Galla,'' says the ‘ balneator) ⁴⁴ Don't disturb her, she’s
asleep;'’ and so he takes a second dole.

127. Ipse dies pulcro] Here follows an account of the divisions of
the day, which he calls a ‘ fair ordering ’ ironically. The distribution
of the dole is the first thing in the morning; then the great man goes
to the forum and the law courts, and returns home about dinner time.

wearied and disapXointeth because he does not ask them to dinner, as
rich men used to o before the ‘ sportula’ was invented. We have
a scene below (iii. 249, sqq.) of slaves carrying awav hot viands in
the asternoon3 it appears, therefore, that people could take the earn·
ings of their servility either iu the morning or in the afternoon.

128. jurisque peritus Apollo] In the Forum Augusti there was a
statue of Apollo inlaid with ivory. This forum had two porticos, in one
of which were statues of Aeneas and the Roman kings‚ and in the other

· those of distinguished soldiers. Among all Apollo’s attributes law

was not one, and he is called ‘juris peritus ’ simply because he was
always listening to lawyers. With ‘ triumphales ' supply ‘ statuae.’

130. Aeyyptms atque Araban-hoa} This last title has caused a good
deal of trouble. It must have been that of some Roman officer of
consideration in the province of Egypt, whatever his duties may have
been. Mayor considers it a nickname‚ and translates it by ‘⁶ nabob,’'
·‘ great mogul.'’ Juvenal is indignant that a provincial officer should
have had a public statue, with his services inscribed on the pedestal
(titulos), set up for him among the great men in the forum.

132. Ῡεειίὸηίίε abeunt} The ⁶ vestibulum ' was a porch leading from
the street to the door o the house. These porches were attached to
large houses only3 and in them the retainers sat. And Juvenal says
that when they came home with their patron. they got no farther
than the porch, and, receiving no invitation to dinner, they laid aside
their hopes for the first time, and went away to buy a poor supper aml
firing to dress it, while their lord and master went in to a fine dinner
which he enioyed by himself. ‘ Rex‚' as applied to the rich, is not
