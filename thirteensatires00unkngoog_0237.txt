SATIRE xm. 221

intention (voluntas) cannot be discovered unless he shows it by some
act, the law properly looked to what the man did as the evidence of
what he intended to do ς and accordingly if he failed to do what his
act showed that he intended to do, he was punished just as if he had
accomplished his purpose.

210. Cedo εἰ conata pereyit 5'] “ Come tell me what if he has accom-
plished his purpose ’.ἱ ” He means Calvinus's man. The man's condi·
tion under the effects of a bad conscience is powerfully imagined.

213. llaefficili crescente cibo .·] This expresses a common feeling which
I have never seen expressed in modern books: the jaws, weary with
weakness and want of appetite, trying vainly to grind the meat that
mocks them. Sick persons and those in grief know what this means.

sed vina misellus] ⁸ Sed' means ‘ not only so, bnt even his wine the
poor wretch cannot swallow;' or it may be taken as meaning ‘ sed
tamen :' “ though his jaws are dry, he cannot swallow his wine.’' The
Alban wine is mentioned in v. 33. Falernian wine was strong and
required keeping. ‘ Si ' is omitted from the protasis of the conditional
sentence in verses 215-6.

218. jam membra quiescunt‚] ‘ J am ' is ‘ at length.’

220. mentem sudoribus uryet,] This is a strong and expressive word
for ‘ terroribus‚' but not so used elsewhere, I believe ; compare i. 167.
⁴ Sacra ' is explained by ‘ major humana) The old poets would render
it ‘⁶ thy religious ghost.'’ ‘ Imago ' is the unsubstantial body (εἴδωλον)
of the dead. Here it is used for a supernatural vision of the living.
⁴ Hi ’ means ‘such as he.'

225. Νοη quasijbnue’tus] ‘ Fortuitus ’ is to be pronounced as a word
of three syllables by synizesis. Horace makes the ‘i' long in “ Nec
fortuitum spernere caespitem '' (C. ii. 15. 17). Forcellini however
,thinks it is common. The authorities, except these two places, are
inferior writers. The aneieuts believed that thunderbolts, lightning,
and meteors either came from the stars with messages to mankind, or
arose from accidental physical causes. These latter they called ‘ bruta
fulmina ' or ‘ fortuita,' the others ‘ fatidica! ‘ Judicet ’ means ‘it
comes to jud and punish men.’

227. Illa ni il nocuit‚] ‘ Suppose that has done him no harm, he is
all the more anxious, waiting for the next storm, as if it was only kept
off by this short lull! Those who have witnessed a tropical storm
klpog, wiffifiut the help of a guilty conscience, the ominous character of
t e rst .

233. Laribus cristam promittere qam] See note on xii. 96, and as to
‘ sacello,' see x. 354, n. With ‘ nocentibus aegris) compare verse 124.

ι It means ‘ the sick if they be guilty!

235. vel quae non di9nzor hostia vita 5³] This is most severe of all. The
life of any animal that could be offered in sacrifice was worth more
than his. The theory of sacrifice rests upon the innocence of the
victim, and mischievous animale would not be accepted.

236. Mobiliset varia est] He sayS, by way of consoling his friend,
that the man who has cheated him is sure to come to punishment; for
such is generally (fenne) the nature of the wicked that they fluctuate
between sin and remorse ς while their crime is doing, they are firm
