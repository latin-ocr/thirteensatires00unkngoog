by others to belong to the reign of Hadrian, that is not far from the
time when this satire was written. The cathedral of Tivoli is built on
the foundations ot· the temple ot* Hercules, who was worshipped above
other gods at Tibur. The enormous buildings erected by Hadrian at
the foot of the hilis of Tibur could hardly have been built when ‹Juve-
nal wrote these verses, or they would probably have been referred to,
for in magnifioenee they surpassed any thing in Italy. Their ruins are
the admiration of travellers.

91. Ut spado vincebat] Posides was a freedman of Claudius the
emperor, savored and afterwards suspected by him. Where he built
his magnificent house does not appear. lt may have been near his
baths at Baiae. ⁴ Capitolia nostra ’ is here op osed to the temples at
Praeneste and Tibur; but large temples of upiter in other towns,
besides the great temple in Rome, were sometimes called Capitolium.
The plural is used (as in x. 65) because of the tripartite character of
the building (xii. 3, n.).

93. Freyit opes‚] This is the common verb in this case. We use the
same when we s ak of breaking.

94. turbavit fi-e'us ameas‚] See vii. 129, “ Sic Pedo conturbat.” The
use of ‘ dum ' with the present followed by a verb in the perfect tense,
which here occurs twice over, is common. See A. 58, 2, e ς Η. 467, 4 ;
and compare i. 59, and elsewhere.

96. metuentem sabbata patrem] He goes on to say that some men
whose fathers were superstitious and paid respect to the Jewish re-
ligion go further and turn Jews. ‘ Metus,’ ‘ metu0,’ are ordinarily used
for religious sear (verse 101). From the courts of the temple being
uncovered the Jews were supposed by the vulgar to worship the skies.

98. Nec distare putant] That is, they abstain from hog's flesh as they
would from man’s. The quadrupe-ds forbidden to the Israelites for
{ffld were all which did not chew the cud and were not cloven·sooted

vit. xi.).

102. Tradidit arcano This is merely random talk. There was
nothing analogous in t e books of Moses to the ‘ arcana' of the
Roman worship, though they were looked upon as unintelligible and
were ῑΙιὲτεῩῗτθ supposed to have a mysterious meaning revealed to the
initiate on .

103. Nonymonstrare vias] He says the law of Moses teaches Jews
not to show any one the way except he be a Jew, nor to tell the tired
traveller where he may quench his thirst. The Romans might be for-
given for this interpretation of the law of Moses when the Jews' own
traditions and tenchers told them they must love their neighbor and
hate their enemy (see St. Matt. v. 43) ; aud Jew and Samaritan
thought it strange that our Saviour asked for water from a Samaritani
woman and talked with her. The old law was not of this tenor. ‘⁴ If
thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat, and it he be thirsty
give him water to drink.'’ is Solomon’s interpretation of the law
(Prov. xxv. 21)·, and the parable of the good Samaritan suecoring a
Jew was used to illustrate the fundamental rule, “ Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.’' See besides Ex. xxiii. 4, 5. ‘Monstrare' and
⁶ deducere ’ are in a kind of apposition with ‘ jus!
