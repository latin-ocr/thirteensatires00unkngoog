116 notras.

12. Hic, ubi nocturnae] ‘ Constituo' is used absolutely for making
an appointment as we say, with either a dative ot the person or an
ablative with ‘cum.’ The nature of the appointment is usually ex·
pressed. Here it is easily understood. The grove where Numa is
said to have met his' mistress and teacher Aegeria was close to the
Porta Capena. It had a sountain in it. Numa was said to have built
a shrine there, and to have dedicated the whole to the Camenae, of
whom Aegeria was one. It appears that the Jews, on payment of a
certain rent, were allowed to inhabit this place when they were for-
bidden the city, as they were during the reign of Domitian. They
were so poor that he says their whole furniture consisted in a basket
and a bed of hay. They were not allowed to trade, and were driven,
it gppeaffs, ,to beg. From ‘cophinus’ (κόφινος) are derived ‘coffin’
an ‘ co er.

15. Omnis enim populo] ‘ Populo ’ means, of course, the Romans.
‘ Merces ' is the proper word for rent. Domitian was very severe in
collecting the taxes from the Jews. A poll-tax of two drachmae was
levied from all Jews and Christians throughout the empire. 'l'his
was lin addition to the ‘merces ς’ it went to the ‘fiscus, not to the

o e. ’

Pell. . ejectis mendicat silva Camenis] The Camenae to whom the woml
was dedicated, and who are here said to have been ejected to make
way for beggam, were not the Muses, though by the Latin poets the
two names are confounded‚ from Camenae being connected with Car·
men in the sense of a prophecy. They were four prophetie divinities
peguliar to Italy. Their names were Antevorta, Postvorta, Carmenta,
an Ae eria.

17. ἦν vallem Aeyere'ae] This is supposed to be the valley now called
La Caffarenac lt is oue of the sources of the small river Almo.
Juvenal speaks of artificial grottos‚ but does not probably mean inore
than one. He says it was not like a natural cave, and that the divin-
ity of the stream, or the spring where the divinity was supposed to
live, would look much better if the fountain had a grass margin there
than with marble spoiling the native stone. There was probably a
statue in that grotto representing the god, as there is still in that
mentioned above.

20. inqenuum violarent marmora tophum] ‘ Tophus ' is ‘ rotten-stone.’
‘ Ingenuum ' means ‘ plain, unsophisticated,' and ‘ violare‚' ⁶ to spoil.’

25. ubi Daedalus eruit alas,] The legend of Daedalus flying from
Crete and alighting first at Cumae, where he dedicated his wings to
Phoebus, is told by= Virgil (Aen. vi. 14, sqq.).

27. Dum superest Lachesi] ln'the Greek conception of the Μοῖραι,
who according to Hesiod were three, Clotho, LachesiS, and Atropos,
it was Clotho’s business to spin the thread of human life. Lachesis
determined the duration and condition of it. But, as in Horace, the
three sisters are sometimes represented as spinning, aud here Clotho's
functions are usurped by Lachesis.

29. Cedamus patria :l See Merivale‚ v. 196.

vivant Artorius istic] These are names, according to the Scholiast,
