69. Quae yenuae’num aqitent] ‘ To plague his grinders.’ The subjunc-
tive means that the bread was given for that purpose, as ‘ qui ponere
cogat' below (73), ‘to compel you to put it down.’ A. 64, l; Η.
489, 11.; B. 1212. ‘ Genuini dentes ’ are ‘ the wisdom-teeth ’
(σωφρπιστῆρες) οι· ‘ the grinders.’

¹70. nwllique siliyine sactus] Pliny distinguishes ‘ siligo ' from wheat
(triticum) and barley (hordeum). It was a fine grain; and the bread
made from it would be very different from the ‘farina' which the
black slave sulkily offers the guest.

72. Salva sit artoptae reverentia] ‘The respect for the breul-pan
must be maintained.’ ‘ Artopta ’ 1s the Greek ἅρτὸπτης.

73. Improbulum,] This diminutive is found here only. The poor
man is no better than a thies if he puts his hand into the wrong bread-
basket. ‘ Superest illic,’ ‘ there is one standing over you there ’ (as if
the man were pointed out). On the form of the sentence see A. 60,
1, b; H. 535, 2; and compare i. 155.

74. Vis tu consuetis] The words are supposed to be those of the
slave standing by telling the rash guest to be satisfied with his own
sort of bread. The formula is one of bidding or exhortation, and

ἐξ81.. εφιὶῖία,] This is here a lobster. It is generally used for a prawn
or shrimp. ‘ Asparagus’ is commonly used in the plural.

84. constrictus cammarus ¹ Cammarus ’ (κᾶμμαρος) was a crayflsh
or a crab of some sort. ‘ onstrictus,’ Ι think, describes the pinched
miset-able appearance of the crab; half a hard egg was served with it.
⁴ Feralis coena,' ‘ a funeral supper,' refers to the ‘ silicernium,’ a din-
ner usually given after afuneral, and attended by the friends of the
dead person. The fare was not very tempting.
