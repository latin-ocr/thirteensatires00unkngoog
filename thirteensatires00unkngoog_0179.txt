SATmn vm. 163

Why, a consul driven horses and takes care of them and freqiients
low taverns (146-162). Such faults should be left with boyhood.
The legate is to be found in the worst company; you would send to
the fields a slave who should act thus (163-182). It is worse yet
when our great men go upon the stage and flght in the arena, choosing
disgrace (183-210). Many were Nero's crimes; but it was worst of
all when he sang in theam-es, and strove for the parsley crown
(211-230). Catilina and Cethegus were free-born ; Cicero was
ignoble, yet he won a greater victory than Octavius. Marius, too,
and the Decii, and the last good king, were of lowly birth; a slave
saved the city, when the consul’s sons would have betrayed it
(231-268). You had better be the son of Thersites and like Achilles,
than be the son of Achilles and like Thersites. Go back as far as
you will, your pro enitor was at best a shepherd (269-275).

1. Stemmata qui saciunc?] The Romans had in their ‘ atria’ waxen
busts of their ancestors, which were carried in all funeral processions'
of the family. They had also tables of their pedigree‚ in which there
wem-gffzffts with wrea‹;’,hsfl{winedf aKIout them; and on tthelse Ἔτει
mscri e names an o ces o e persons represen e . ic
tables came to be called ‘ stemmata' from these wreaths. ‘ Pictos
vultus ’ are the portraits on these genealogical trees.

2. Sanquine censeri] This construction of ‘ censere ’ with the abla-
tive is not found in the writers before the empire. lt is the ablative
of valne, and ‘longo sanguine censeri' is to be valued at the worth
of a long line of ancestors.

3. stantes in curribus} See vii. 125, n.; x. 59. The only historieal
Aemilianus when this was written was the younger Scipio, who was
born of the Aemilia gens, an old patrician family. His father was
L. Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, but he was ado ted by P. Cornelius
Scipio, the son of the elder Scipio Africanus. he fun name of the

were a plebeian family, of whom M. Curius Dentatus was the first
distinguished member. Corvinus was a cognomen of the Valeria
gens, a very old family. The Galbae belonged to the Sulpicia gens,
which was patrician and of great antiquity. ‘Jam dimidios ' means
that they are broken in half. Other waxen busts are supposed to
have lost an arm or to have a piece out of the shoulder.

6. qeneris tabula A great roll of his ancestors that the man is sup·
posed to keep. ' he commentators now are generally agreed in
rejecting the next verse. Heinrich, who does s0, supposes by ‘ virga ’
the interpolator meant a broom to keep the busts clean3 the Scholiast
takes it for the ‘ fasces!

8. Fumaws Equitum] In the middle of the ‘ atrium ’ was a ‘ focus ⁹
round which were the images of the Lares. The family chart would
soon get smoked. A Dictator w⁸2⁸ in early times called ‘ magister

who was called ‘ magister equitum,' for what reason is not certain.
