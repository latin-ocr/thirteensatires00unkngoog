18⁷. Plurima felix] He says, ‘⁴ Philosophy is the means of happi-
ness, and by degrees ‹livests us of the greater part of natural defecta
and all our faults of judgment; ’twas she first taught us right from
wrong, for certainly it's only dwarfed, infirm, and little minds that love
revenge; which you may gather straight from this, that no one likes it
better than a woman.” ‘ Minutus ’ is a participle, and had better here
be rendered as such. ‘ Vitia’ are faults of nature, some ot' which
cannot be eradicated. ‘ Errores ’ correspond to ‘ culpas,’ and are faults
of practice. As to ‘ Sapientia‚' see on verse 20.

192. Cur taenea] These lines are very vigorous. He begins to
illustrate what he said in the first four lines. ⁸ Attonitos ’ is used as
in xii. 21. On ‘ surdo,’ see note on vii. 71. Who Caedicius was it is
impossible to say. The Scholiast tells us he was a courtier and most
fruel satellite of Nero. Rhadamanthus was one ot' thejudges in the

olgrfflvgffirtano cuidam respondit] This story is put by Herodotus
into the mouth of Leotychidem the Spartan, in an address to the
Athenians. He warns them against breaking their saith by relating
the fate of one Glaucus who bore the highest reputation for honesty
in all Sparta. A man of Miletus came to him and said that, in con-
sequence of his reputation for just dealing, he wished to deposit half
his fortune with him. Glaucus accepted the deposit, and promised to
restore the money to any one who should produce certain tokens and
claim it. This the man's sons afterwards did; but Glaucus prot‘essed
to have forgotten all about the matter, and required four months to
refresh his meinory. This time he employed in consulting the oracle
at Delphi as to whether he might not keep the money and swear he
had never received it. The answer of the oracle was conveyed in
seven hexameters denouncing dreadful punishment on the breaker of
oaths 3 and Glaucus, begging pardon ot‘ the god, paid the money. The
priestess did not let him go without a wholesome warning, saying, τὸ
πειρηθῆναι τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι ἴσον ὁὺνασθαι, he who teinpts God is as
bad as he who does the wickedness which it is in his mind to dc.
Leotychides winds up his story by saying that Glaucus had not one
descendant left, but his whole house was extinct3 and his moral is
that a good man has no other thought about a deposit than to return
it when it is called for.

200. quod dubitaret Depositum retinere We should say ‘ dubitavit
reddere,’ he hesitated about restoring. ut he also hesitated about
keeping the money, and that was his offence.

209. Nam scelus intra se tacitum] lt has been thought that Juvenal
could not have got this sentiment without the light of Christianity, in
the moral teaching of which no doubt it is afundamental rule. But the
ethics of Christianity are no new invention. They do but enforce
the teaching of conscience, which has only to be free and it will tell a
man, without further revelation, that evil desires are sin, especially in
the case that Juvenal supposeS, where cowardice, not principle (mori-
bus, verse 204), preventa the accomplishment of them. The Roman
law adopted the principle of punishing for the intention to commit a
crime, just the same as if the crime were committed. But as a man's
