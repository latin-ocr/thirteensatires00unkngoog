SATIRE 111. 131

296. Ede ubi consistas .·] He treats him as a Jew beggar‚ and asks

him where he posts himself to beg, in what ‘ proseucha ’ he must look
for him-if he wants to find him. A ‘proseucha' was an oratory, a
building erected for the use of those towns where there was no syna-
gogue, outside the walls by a stream or the sea-side, for the benerit of
ablutiou. lt was used like the synagogae for reading the law and prayer
three times a day. In the Acts of the Apostles (xvi. 13) the writer says
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἑξῆλθομεν ἔξω τῆς· πόλεως (Philippi) παρὰ ποταμὸν,
οὐ ἐνομίζετο προυευχὴ εἶναι, and there προσευχὴ 1s generally understood
to be a building of this sort. In the Gospel by st. Luke (vi. 12) our
Saviour is said to have passed the night ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ θεοῦ, where
also Whitby and other commentatore take προσευχὴ for a house ot’
prayer. As to the use of the present in ‘ quaero‚' Madvig says in his
⁸ Opuscula: ' “ The Latius almost always use the present indicative
when they are asking about a thing which they do not doubt that they
will do, or are asking the opinion oi* another in such a way that they
are not so much deliberating as expressing a necessary judgment, or
are asking others what opinion they wish them to hold.'’

senses, they affect to be the injured parties, and declare they will have
‘the law of him. The state of the streets at night, even during the
time of Augustus, was very disgraceful. Tacitus describes it in the
,time of Ner0, who himself set the example of night-brawling, which
was followed by many under the shelter of his name. The same trick·
‚u Εέῗὶέῗῖῖῖιδιῗιξ cybi-{griffi ‹giffrgrtnlffr‘esrinrffigitgr ' means ‘ a highway-rob-
ber; ' and it appears from this place that the Pomptine Marshes and
the forest of Gallinaria were infested by banditti. Augustus took
great ains to put them down, and so did Tiberius ; and it would seem
from ‚fuvenars words that their plan of having military posts in the
different places the robbers frequented was still pursued. Driven out
from the above haunts, they took up their abode in the city, where they
carried on their trade (which is the meaning of ‘ agit rem Ἰ, breaking
into houses and murdering the inhabitants. ‘ Subitus ’ seems to mean
that you start up from sleep‚ and find one of these men by your bed
ready to cut your throat.

was a lain in Elatium. about twenty-two miles in length. extending
from ppii Forum to Terracina, and from eight to ten miles in depth
on the west, separated from the sea by a low range of hills ending in
the promontory of Circeii, and by a lower rid ge from that- place to Ter·
racina. In the early period of Roman history it was fertile and popu-
lous ; and when Appius made his road across it, about n.c. 310, the
soil must have been firm. The character of the count must have
changed at no great distance of time. The neglect o the middle
ages made the marshes worse than they ever were in the Roman
period. Various popes did something towards correctius: the evil, the

over a space of sixteen years, are those to which the present drainage
