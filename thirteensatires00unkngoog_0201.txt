Juvenal says if he had never said a better thing than that he might
have snapped his fingers at Antonius, quoting his own words (Phil. ii.
46): “ Contempsi Catilinae gladios, non pertimescam tuos.'' On the
use of ‘potuit, consult A. 59, 3, ες H. 512, 2, 13 B. 1274. The pre·
ceding verse might be taken as the subject of this verb, by a not
uncommon figure, a man's‘ way of speaking being put for the man
himself. He adds, he would rather have been the author of his ridic-
ulous poetry than of that Philippic which he calls divine, famous, aud
so forth. This speech was written in September, nc. 44, as a rejoin·
der to Antonius's reply to the first Philippic. Cicero did not attend
the meeting of the Senate at which Antonius spoke‚ and though tuis

immediately. ‘ Volveris ’ means ‘you are read, ' ‘a prima proxima'
is a way of expressing the second.

126. illum Exitus eripuit,] After the death of Alexander, Demos·
thenes used all hie eloquence to produce a general rising of the Greek
states against Antipater, the successor to the Macedonian division of
Alexander’s kingdom, and sucoeeded. But the resistance of the
Greeks was not effectual, and, rather than fall into the hands of An-
tipater, Demosthenes poisoned himself, ac. 322 ·

128. moderantem fraena theatra} The pular assemblies (ἐκκλησίαι)
were held in the Pnyx, a space ο groun near the Areiopagus, till the
building of the theatre of Dionysus in the Lenaea, about nic. 340, after
which the assemblies were commonly held in the theatre. It was
finished in Demosthenes's time, and he must often have spoken there.

129. Dis ille adversis] This is a common way of speaking. Demos·
thenes's father was a man of property, and died when his son was

Juvenal has made the most of.

133. mancis affixa tropmoeis] His next case is the vanity of military
glory. The practice of erecting trophies after victories was very
ancient in Greece‚ and adopted by the Romans late in the republican
times. They were composed of arms taken from the enemy and iled
up usually on the trunk of a tree or some low wooden frame. ⁴ uc-
culae ' are the cheeks of a helmet which were buttoned under the chin.
‘ Buckle ' is derived from this word. ‘ Cassis ’ is properly a helmet of
metal, ‘ galea' of leather. Some ‘ galeae ⁹ had vizors which covered
thigagQEt curtum temone jnyum] A war chariot shorn of its pole.
‘ Curtum ' is not used elsewhere with a noun after it. but it is properly
a participle. ‘ Aplustre ’ is the curved ornament which most ancient
ships carried on their stem, commonly of a fan shape‚ and not unlike
