32. Quarum Faesidium laudm] Faesidius is a ‘¹ causidicus,’ but a man
of substance, who has clients that come into court and applaud him
loudly. ⁴ Sportula' means the clients who get the ‘ sportula ’ (i. 95,
n.). The omission of ⁸ tanto ' before ‘ quanto ’ is common (see x.
13). Pliny describes with a good deal of disgust how young men with
no qualifications thrust themselves into the inferior courts, and adds
what is to the int here: that these pleaders are followed by auditore
of a like kin , slaves whom they have hired for the purpose3 they
collect in the middle of the basilica, where the ‘ sportula ’ is served out
to them as openly as in the dining—room: these fellows go about from
court to court for the same pay (the ‘sportula’)‚ from which they
have got the name συφοκλιῑς (because they cried σοφῶς. as we say
⁸ bravo ’) or in Latin ⁴ laudieani.'

33. senior bulla diynisse'mffl He means he< must be in his second child·
hood. The Gmeks said, όὶς παῖδες οἱ γέροντες. ⁴ Bulla' is explained ,
on v. 164. In verse 36, ⁴ ut' is easily sup 'ed before ‘putet’ For
thre 1ιὶιεο of ‘ quoquam‚' see on x. 184. The tar is red with the blood
o t e victim.

40. Saturnus fieyiensd That is, before Saturnus was driven from
Olympus by Jupiter and took to the reaping·hook in Latium, where
he taught the natives agriculture and became king of the country. He
is usually represented with a reaping·hook in his hand. The Greek
legends varied as to the place where Zeus was brought up when his
mother Rhea hid him from his father Cronus. The common sto. y
was that she took him to Crete, where he was educated. Ida was a
mountain mass of considerable height in Crete. See xiv. 271, n.

42. Nulla saper nubes] These feasts of the gods belong, he means,
to a later age than that of Saturnus, to the age of heroes, which He·
siod places the fourth in his list. ‘ Puer Iliacus ' is Gan medes. He
is represented as the son of Tros, or of Ilus the son of ros. Either
way Troas was his native country. and he was carried off, according
to the common account, from the Trojan Ida. He is said to have suc·
ceeded Hebe as cup-bearet of the gods. She was a daughter· of Jupi-
ter and Juno, and became the wife of Hercules. ‘ Ad cyathos ' is the
ordinary way of expressin this office. ⁷

44. etjam siccato nectare ‘ Et ’ sometimes follows ‘ nec ' to carry on
the negation. See Krueger, Lat. Grammatik, 533, Anm. 4, a, 3. Juve-
nal groups Hebe and Vulcan together, and they make a picturesque
contrast. He comes in reeking from his work. She is at her task on
Olympus, and hands him a cup to refresh him, which he first drains
and then wipes off the sweat from his black arms. All this Juvenal

says ‘ prandebat’ because the ‘prandium ’ (which we call luncheon)
was a plain meal. The dative seems to be that “ of advantage.” See
A. 51, 7, and note. Juvenal is ridiculing the polytheism of the poets
and the gigantic system of vice sanctioned by divine example. ’

4¹7. Talis ur est hodia] ‘ Talis ' is equivalent to ‘ tanta.' This use of the
word is less common where only quantity and not quality is expressed.
