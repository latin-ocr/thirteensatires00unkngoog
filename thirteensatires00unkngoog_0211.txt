sATIRn XI. 195

20. „ascellam luda] ‘ Miscellanea’ is a mess of all sorts of things,
as the Scholiast explains it. Having spent all he had to spend, the
malzln ‹iomes to put up with gladiators' fare. ‘ Ludus ' is the lanista's
⁸⁰23? ‘Refirt crya quis haec eademptareu] ‘Ergo’ is ‘as 1 said,' going
back ’to verse 1 (see x. 54, n.: “Ergo supervacua,'' etc). ‘Refert
(rem fert), it makes a difference. ‘ Haec eadem ’ is these said dainties.
Ventidius is put, as Atticus was, for any wealthy person. The sub-
ject of ‘est,' ‘ sumit,’ ⁴ trahit-⁹ is ‘ haec eadem parare)

2⁵. hic tamen idem Iynoret] “ While he, the very same man, knows
not the great differ-enee between alittle bag and an iron-bound chest.'’
He has learnt at school that Atlas is the highest mountain range in
Africa, but does not know the great distance between his means and ⁴*
those of Ventidius and the like. The change in the mode to the
subjunctive in ‘ignoret’ is to express a causal idea3 “while yet he
does not know.” The first relative clause is simply adiectival. The
saying γνῶθι σεωυτὸν is attributed to each of the seven wise men, to
Pythagoras, to Socrates, and to the Delphic oraclo, to which or some
other divine source Juvenal ascribes it.

30. nec mim loricam poscit] Thersites knew himself better than to
try for the armor of Achilles, in which Ulysses cut a doubtful figure.
‘ 'I'raducere ' is used in this sense of exposure in viii. 17. ‘Ancipitem '
ffirleestvffll ⁴ {ef ‘Ittrlneans thatth didunot look like himself, people

1 no ow imm earmoro cies. ’

32. seu ιιι ηιοῃηο] ‘ Seu’ is opposed to ‘sive' in verse 28 (sive
quaeras vel velis—seu affectas), and a new verb is introduced, a
common change of construction3 there is a sort of anacoluthon, the
indefinite person addressed seeming to be defined in ‘ tu.' ‘ Buccae’
is used for a ranting noisy fellow, who blows out his cheeks like a
bladder, and emits nothin but the wind that fills them.

36. quum piscis emetur ‘ Gobio ’ or ‘ cobio.’ as it appears to be
sometimes spelt‚ is a gudgeon. ‘ Saeculus ³ (27), ‘ loculus, ‘crumena,'
are all the same, a leather purse worn in the folds of the toga or
the girdle. ‘ Loculus ' is always used in the plural, because, it would
seem, there were several compartments for holding different kinds ot
coin. ‘ Argentum grave ' is silver in bars or plates (laminae).

39. Et crescente ‚qula That is ‘et tamen,' as we have it repeatedly.

41. exit Annulus] he ring was properly the mark of equestrian
ord senawrian rank. Pollio would seem to belong to one of those
o ers.

44. Non praemetet& cineres] He says it is not premature death that
is sorrow to the riotous liver, but· he has more reason to sear age
than death, an old age of bankruptcy and exile from the soene of his
pleasures. ‘Luxuria' has always a bad sense. ‘ Luxury ' does not
express it. It is wauton excess. ‘ Paullum nescio quid ' is a way of
expressing a very little. ‘ Fenoris auctor ’ for ⁴ fenerator ' is an un-
eommon expression. ‘ ‘Solum vertere' is a sort of euphemism for
