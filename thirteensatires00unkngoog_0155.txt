sATIRn 1v. 139

112. Fuscus, Cornelius Fuscus was employed by Vespasian in high
commands, an by Domitian as ‘ praefectus' of the praetorias troops.
He was sent by him on an expedition against the Daci, and was killed,
together with the greater part of his army, by that people. Tacitus
describes him (in Aa). 69) as ‘vigens aetate, claris natalibus,' and as
one who loved danger for its own sake. Juvenal says he thought ot*
battles in his marble villa; retirement and the degrading life of a
Roman senator of this day did not suit him, and he was glad, no doubt,
to be ern loyed on the rough service in which he lost his lise.

113. ciente Catulla] Fabricius Veient0, whom he calls ‘ crafty,' is
mentioned above, iii. 185. Pliny describes Catullus as blind and of a
savage disposition. He had neither reverence, modesty, nor pity, and
so Domitian used him, as a man uses arrows, to shoot at all the best
of men.

116. dir-tesqua a ponte satelles] The man was one who should have
been found begging on the Appia Via of the passengers in their car·
riages going down to Aricia, which was about sixteen miles 'from
Rome and full of country houses. As the Appia Via approached
Aricia, it went down into the Vallis Aricina, and the descent was
called Clivus Aricinus. It appears that beggars were in the habit of
posting themselves at the top of this hill. On the construction with
‘ Dignns‚' see A. 65, 2,f; H. 501, 111.; B. 1226.

119. rhombum stupuit:} See A. 52, 1, (13 H. 371, 3, 1; Β. 716.

121. Sic puqnas Cilicis laudabat] It appears that Cilician gladiators
were common. ⁸ Pegmass which has its name from the Greek mzy-
νὺναι, was used for different things made of wood. but in connection
with the theatre. ‘ Pegmata ' were great wooden structures which
formed stages; and bad two or more storieS, which let up and down
by machinery. Upon these gladiators fought, and other exhibitions
took place. The ‘ velaria ’ were an awning drawn over the seats of
the amphitheatre to keep out the sun and rain. By some ingenious
contrivance‚ it appears, a boy was suddenly carried up to the awning
from the ‘pegma’ for the amusement of the spectators; and this
blind flatterer pretended to admire a thing he could not see, just as
now he admires the fish, looking to the left where it was not.

127. Excidet Arvirayus :l There is no British prince of this name on
record contemporary with Domitian. The man is talking nonsense,
and knows it. ‘ Aut ' means ‘ or at least!

129. Fabricio] This was Veiento’s name. The Fabricia gens was
plebeian, but an old family.

130. Quidnam {qitur censes 2] The question is put in the usual for-
mula to 'the‘⁴ senate. On ‘cgnciditurss see once more iii. 296, n. “I
