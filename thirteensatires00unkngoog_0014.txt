viii 1211OE on JUVENAL.

Of J uvenal’s personal character it is not very easy to
form an estimate from his writings. That his invectives
against the vices of his time are not the mere artistic
and declamat-cry compositions which some writers suppose
them to be, but the fruits of an honest indignation‚ of rare
powers of saronem, and of a large knowledge of the world,
Ι think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing
with the foulest vices, but there is no appearance of his
being himself a loose liver in any part of his writings.
When Horace is coarse, he betrays something of sympathy
with vice, while Juvenal shows only contempt for it.
Although therefore an expurgated edition of Juvenal
would. have more gaps than an expurgated edition of
Horace, a well-regulated mind would be less offended
with the entire text of Juvenal than with that of Horace.
J uvenal’s morality was of a higher and less technical sort
than Horace’s‚ and has led some into the notion that he
drew it from the purest source, and was in understanding,
if not by profession, a Christian. This of course is absurd.
He knew human nature, and he knew right from wrong,
and was.not blinded by sels-indulgence, and so was able
to state the law of conscience in a way to astonish some
Christians to whom that law is very imperfect] y known.

Apart from his morality‚ Juvenal was a great master of
words, and had a large fund of illustration. His pictures
drawn from real life, as I have observed in the course of
the notes, are particularly happy3 whether they represent
«the common room of a tavern, or the deck of a ship, or
the inside of a soldier’s hut or of a camp, or a school-room,
or the greedy crowd at the sportula, or the streets of
Rome, or a drunken brawl, these and a hundred other
soenes are so drawn that an artist would have no difficulty
