was the son of a school-master at Neapolis. He was patronized by
Domitian, whom he flattered in the usual way. liis poem called

Aa). 81. , During the time it was composing he recited parts of it, and
at that time he seems to have been poor. Whether he afterwards
profitecl by the patronage of the emperor or not is unknown. By
Juvenal’s description his poem seems to have been highly thought of,
and his manner of reciting it was attractive.

and in order to gratify more applicante the office was made half·
