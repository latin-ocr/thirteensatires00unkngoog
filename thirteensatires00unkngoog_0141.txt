since they owed it (to themselves) to emigrate.' See A. 60, 2, c and

1274. He means to say that the poor ought not to have waited at
Rome to be brought to this contemptible condition, but long ago to
have migrated in a body, as he and his family were doing.

1611. ”Ii-aud {acilefmeryu-nt] “ Slow ,rises worth by poverty de-
prisfisgf mlgqgg fflzffteugerssggabmuglheffroeztfiiffim gxhpgoe put for a
lodging, ‘ coenaculum‚' an upper story room, such as those in which
most poor men lived. Even for such a miserable lodging the speaker
says they had to pay a high rent, and they could not do wit out a
certain number of slaveS, whose bellies must be filled, and their frugal
family meal eost a good deal. The customary number of slaves in
{ivery household had grown enormously even since the days of

orace.

168. Fictilibus coenare pudet,] Men are ashamed to dine off eas-then-
ware‚ though they are not so when they leave Rome and suddenly
find themselves in the country, with plain fare before them. This
seems to be the meaning, and ‘negavit,’ the reading of all the MSS„
will bear it, if understood in an aoristic sense. The Marsi were of
gabinue origin, and all who were so were included under the name

abe ’.

170. veneto duroque cucullo. ‘ Venetus ' is ‘ sea-green.' ‘Cucullus '
was a hood attached to the ‘ rna.' Ruperti approves of ‘culullus,'
a sort of cup, as a substitute for ‘ cucullus, because Umbricius is talk-
in about dinin .

{71- si vmmgadmittimus‚] This is a sort of phrase like ‘ne nobis
blandiar ¹ (verse 126). He says that no one wears the toga in a large
part of Italy till he is dead, when the body of a free rson was al-
ways clad in a toga such as accorded with his rank. n the country
towns dress was still very simple3 at Rome it was different.

174. tandemque redit ad pulpita] ‘ Tandem ' means after a long inter·
val. It happened rarely; that is, when the annual feast came round
the same old well-known play came with it. ‘Pulpitum' (λογεῖον)
was the front part of the stage, where the actors spoke. ‘ Exodia'
were merx-y interludes‚ introduced after each of the ‘ Atellanae,'
whence the name; though it is doubtful whether, as acted in these
rustic theatres, the ⁶ exodium ’ was strictly of the nature here de-
scribed.

1⁰75. personae pallentis hiatum] The masks used in these ‘exodia'
were of a grotesque kind, such as those used by the Greeks in the
satyrio drama„ These masks had the mouth wide open, representing
broad laughter or grinning.

178. orchestram et po alume] The form of a Roman theatre was
much like the Greek. he scats for the spectatore formed a semi-
circle, and rose by steps from the floor3 the semicircular portion of
which between the seats and the stage was called the orchestra. Here
the chorus performed their part in the Greek theatres; in the Roman
theatre that space was occupied with seats for the magistrates and
