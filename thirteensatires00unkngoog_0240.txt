all his ‘ heredesi it they were in his power at his death. As to ‘bul-
latus ’ see v. 16 ,11.

7. ’qui radere tubera terrae] See v. 116, n., “tradentur tubera‚” and
v. 147, n., “Boletus domino.’' ‘Juvenis ' is opposed to ‘heres bulla-
tus ; ’ the comparison is expressed in ⁴ nee melius! ⁴ Eodem jure ' is
the mushroom sance. The ‘ficedula’ is the ‘beocafico' of modern
Italy, which is also a regular visitor of England‚ and one of the
sweetest songsters in sprinffiand summer. Pettychaps is the English
naturalist's name for it. y the older Enghsh writers it was called
Cyprus-bird. and they speak of it as a great delicacy.

10. Quam ,eluimus anneus] Children for the first seven years were
‘infantes.’ ‘Pueritia’ was not a legal term, and was loosely em-
ployed, though it was commonly used for those ‘impuberes ’ who were
not ‘infantes,' that is from seven to fourteen, or when the ‘toga
virilis ' was taken. ‘ Barbatos ' is equivalent to ⁴ wise and learned.'

13. lavato coenare paratu] The common word is ‘apparatus,' as iu
Horace, C. i. 38, ‘⁸ Persicos odi puer apparatus.''

15. Mitem animum] He asks whether Rutilus (any passionate savage
master) teaches his son the value of a gentle tem r and a calm habit.
that seldom goes wrong, and that slaves are, b y and soul, made of
the same material as ourselves (‘ nostra materia '), or to act the ruffian
like himself, when he sets him the example of flogging them and
delights in the sound of the lash.

20. Antiphates trepidi laris] He says he is the Antiphates and Poly-

hemus of his trembling household. The first was king of the giant
estrygones in Sicily, who sunk the ships of Ulysses and ate up one
of his men (odyss. x. 80-132). This poor wretch of Rutilus’s is sup·
posed to he put to the tortnre of fire for the loss of a couple of towels.
l'here were no legal limits to the torturing of slaves, at least till the

time of the Antoninos.

23. laetus stridore catenae, See xi. 80 and viii. 180, 11. on ‘ergas-
tula’ ‘ Inscripta' means the rand upon the forehead of the slaveS, as
F for ‘fugitivus,' and so forth. The branded ‘ergastula' are the

such a pace (as we say) but that she r'nust take breath thirty times in
the felhng. When she was quite a girl, she was her mother's accom-

lice; now she writes at her mother’s dictation her own little love
etters, and sends them by the same wretches her mother had em-
ployed before her. In this satire on parents this is the only reference
to mothers. ⁴ Cinaedis ' is here only a term of disgust, “ wretches.”
‘ Ferre ' would be ‘ ferendas ' in classical prose. A. 57, 8, j} 3, and see
64. 2; Η. 553, V.; B. 1160.

33. Quum subeunt animos] Juvenal says “ more rapidly and suddenly
