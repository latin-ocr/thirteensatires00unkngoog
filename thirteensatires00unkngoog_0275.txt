lbllowa: 1. It is complete, requiring no grammar for those who take Latin for
a short tune. Β. It is concise without being deficient in material for drill. 3. It
is judicious both in the arrangement of vocabularies, notes, &c., and also in the
gradation of matter. 4. 'I'he “ Essentials of Grammar” and the “ Notes on Syn·
tax ” give, in about 90 pages‚ a very useful and conveniently arranged summary of
all that the ordinary pupil needs to know. 5. ΤῙιο brief synopsis of English
Grammar gives an opportunity (much needed) to review the fundamentals of Eng-
lish Grammar, and compare and contrast them with⁸ those of Latin Grammar.
1 find no other book that combines these advantages.

1¹: is altogether the best Latin book for beginners with which 1 am acquainted.

Professor H. W. Jounsron, Illinois Colleqe, Jacksomiue, Illinois. -1t seems
to me superior to any book of the kind hitherto published, and 1 regard the Essen-
t‘nls of Latin Grammar as the best statement possible of what a boy must learn in
his first year.

Professor Jom« Ι.. coorta, Vandsrbn’lt Pramo-ator, ΒοΙιοοῙ, Νωλνίῑῑε, Teon.—
With reference to the book, 1 can speak only in the highest terms. Indeed‚ 1 do
not think that there has ever been issued an Elementary Latin Exercise Book that
can compare with it in any respect. 1 say this adviscdly, as Ι have examined
almost all issued in this country, and the most prominent English oues; and, with-
out hesitation, 1 pronounce Mr. Co'mstock’s the best book of its kind published.

Professor H. C. Mamm, Hiyh school, Eric, Pa.-1t is very easy to see
that Comstock’s First Latin Book is the work of a thorough macher, who has had
actual experience in the class-room with the difficulties which beginners in Latin
usually meet. Its classification and methods are thorough and complete. The
language is so clear, so simple, and school-like, that the dullest pupil‚ if he read
carefully, should understand without further explanation. ΜΓ. Comstock has hit
the nail on the head. He known just what and just how much grammar is needed
for good, clcan work. We have had Leighton and Jones, — both good, - but we
like Conistock more, oecause it is better.

Professor R. F. Faunum, Head-Master Buffalo Latin School, Buffalo,
N. Y.—1 have examined with care Comstock’s First Lessons in Latin. 'Hie book
shows the hand of a practica] toacher. who understands the difficulties which are
constantly encountered by the beginner in Latin. 1 consider it the best book yet
published on the subject, and shall at once use it in the Buffalo Latin School.

Professor E. S. Smmwar, Rutyers college, New Brumwick‚ N. J. —I know
not when Ι have seen such a combination of thoroughness and practical common-
sense in matter with taste in outer dress. 1 take pleasure in using it myself, and in
recommending it to tcacliers.
