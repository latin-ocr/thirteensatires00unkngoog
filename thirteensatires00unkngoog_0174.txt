161. dirus caput annibal implet ;] Horace uses this epithet for Han·
nibal three times, and the boys were always repeating it. The master
uses it in a double sense. Hannibal’s name was a bugbear with which
nurses frightened children, and the Romans to the latest times held it

166. Haec alii sex Vel plures] This means plenty more. ‘ Sophista'
was a name commonly given to the rhetoricians and grammarians of
this time, as it had been originally to all who were masters of their
