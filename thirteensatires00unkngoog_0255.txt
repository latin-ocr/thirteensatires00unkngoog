to be the famous statue of Memnon, from which it- was believed that
sounds proceeded at the rising of the sun produced by the impression
of his rays. Strabo mentions them, but says that part of one had
fallen owing to an earthquake‚ and that from the part that remained
in its place a sound such as might proceed from a blow was heard once
a day. He himself heard it, and where it came from he professes to
be ignorant, but he is not inclined to believe it issued from the stone.
Pausanias, who visited the statue, found it broken as Strabo described
it, and says it was supposed to have been broken by Cambyses. He
compares the sound to the snapping of a harp-string. Strabo wrote
during the life ot our Saviour, Pausanias at least a hundred and fifty
years after Strabo. Juvenal may have seen the statue about half a
century before Pausanias. In his time, however, the statue which has
since been restored was mutilated, which is the meaning of ‘ dimidio:
as below, verse 56, ‘⁴ vultus Dimidios‚'’ and viii. 4, ‘⁴ Curios jam
dimidios.'’ ‘ Magicae chordae ' implies that Pausanias described the
sound according to popular notions. It is generally supposed to have
been a trick of the priests executed by some simple mechanical con-
trivance. ΤῙιθ statue supposed to be that of Memnon shows evident
marks of having been restored, the body from the waist upwards being
of several pieces and of a different stone from the legs and pedestal,
which are a monolith. When this restoration took place is unknown.
.It is attributed by Heeren to Septimius Severus, who restored some
of the Egyptian monuments. His reign was from Aa). 193 to 211. The
height is about fifty feet, and that of the destal six feet. Memnon,
the son of Eos and Tithonus, was a Gree adaptation from the name
of several Egyptian kings, Phamenoth or Amenophth. The priests'
jugglery may have arisen out of the fabulous birth the Greeks at-
tributed to Memnon as son of the morning.

6. Atque vetus T hebel The notion that ancient Thebes had a hundred
ates was derived from Homer, and was received like other poetical
ables by the Greeks and Romans without much inquiry. Thebes was

perhaps the most ancient-town of Egypt, and was originally the me-

about nc. 520 pillaged and partly destroyed the temples and burnt the
private dwellings. Its downfall was completed about nc. 85, when,
the inhabitants having revolted from Ptolemy Lathyrus, it was taken
after a three years' siege and pillaged. Strabo describes it as in his
day a city of ruins covering a space of eighty stadia (ten miles) in
circuit, while the inhabitants occupied, as they do still, a few villages
on each side of the river. The effect of the ruins is usually described
as overpowering. One sentence of Belzoni’s expresses this effect:
“It appeared to me like entering a city of giants. who after a long
conflict were all destroyed, leaving the ruins of their various temples
as the only roof of their former existence.''

This animal was chiefly worshipped in the city of Bubastis on the
