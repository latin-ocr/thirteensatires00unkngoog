214 nome.

verse 65. For the tense os ‘ effuderit,’ see references on viii. 41. As
to the form ‘a ium‚' seeA. 11, 1., 3,d; Μ. 44, 1, ας Ζ. 66, ⁶511. 89,
11., 3. 1, 2; Β. 15. The Grammars do not seem to agree as to the
frequency of the form. The word ‘ uva' was used by the Romans for
a cluster of bees, as the Greeks used βότρυς. v

⁷1. lmeroepm decem quera-is] Here then we have the sum his friend
had lost, about ⁸400. But suppose 1 tell you (he adds) that another man
has lost twenty times as much in the same way, and a third still more,
so much that a big chest could not hold it‘l He says the corner of
a chest could hardly hold it; that is, every comer of the chest
was full. ‘Arcana ’ is ⁸ arcanum depositum,’ a trust given in private.
By ‘ tam facile ' we are to understand that he is putting not a hypo-
tlietical, but a real case. On the form of the conditional sentence
(verse 75), see A. 59, 4, ‹1; Η. 511, 11.; B. 1271.

76. Aspice quanta Vooe moyse] ⁴ Aspice ⁹ serves to make the object
resent, ancl 1t is conventionally no contradiction to say, See how
oudly he denies it. The man is put before us, and we see him swear-

ing to his lie without changing color or flinching. ⁴ Ficti ' has some·
thing of a concessive meaning: ‘⁴ feigned though it is.’'

78. Tarpee'aquefidme’na] Tne bolts of Jupiter Capitolinus (xii. 6, n.).
‘Framea ’ was a German name for a spear. The ⁴ venatrix puella'
is Diana. As to Cirrha, see vii. 64, n. Poseidon, according to the
Greeks, was especially the god of the Aegaean Sea, in which he had his
residence under the waters, off the coast of Euboea.

84. Gomedam] The man says he will boil his son and eat his poor
head if he is not speaking the truth, first dipping it in Egyptian vine·
gar, which was of the strong kind.

86. Sunt in Fortunae qui] Juvenal uses the indicative in ⁸ nunt,’
because he means a articulat class of tltinkers, perhaps the picure·
ans. See Ζ. 6633 tf 365, obs. 1; H. 501, 2 ; B. 1228. He goes on to
show how men make up their minds to this wickedness, some believ-
ing that there are no gods, others that there are gods, but their anger
is not to be compared with the pleasures of possession, or it will not
come, or at least not yet, and so on. Compare 2 Pet. iii. 4: “ All
thin continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.'’

Βξῗ altaria tanqum. See above, iii. 144, and xiv. 219. ‘ Quaecun-
que' is not common y used without a verb, like ‘ quaevis) Itis so
above, verse 56, and in the following places: iii. 156, twice in iii. 230,
x. 359, xiv. 210. Here it might be taken with ‘tangunt,’ whatever
altars they touch, but J uvenal's practice makes it probable he meant
the other construction.

91. esse deos et pejerat] ‘Et ' is equivalent to ‘ et tamen ' (καίτοι), as
in “probitas laudatur et alget '’ (i. 74). He believes there are gods,
and yet he forswears himself. 'l'he deity he challenges is Isis. ‘ Sis·
trum ’ (from σεὶω) was a rattle much used at festivals of this goddess.
lle says Isis may strike her angi-y ‘sistrum ’ on his eyes and blind
him, still the temptation is too strong3 he had rather lose his sight
and keep the stolen money than keep his eyes and lose the money.
'l'he Latin name of the ⁴ sistrum ' is ⁴ crepitacutuut'
