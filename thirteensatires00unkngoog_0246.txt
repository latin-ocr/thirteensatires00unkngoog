is often used in this way, as the Greeks used τλῆναι, and as we say
‘ a man cannot bear to do a thing? ‘ Minutal ⁹ is minced meat mixed
with chopped vegetables and other things. To keep this from one day
to another in the closest month of the year was a dirty trick. As to
‘ conchem' and ‘ sectivi porri,' see iii. 293. ‘ Lacertus ’ was the name
of some coarse sea-fluit which they used to salt and dry. The ‘ silurus ’
has been mentioned before, iv. 33. This man seals up the fragments
of his miser-able supper, at a time of the year when they cannot fail.

up {in the cupboard too. ⁸ Aestivam ' belongs in meaning to the whole
pre icate.

134. aliquis de ] See iv. 116, n. The use of the fruare tense is
easily explained. prose, however, we should probably find ⁸ negaret '
or ⁴ n et.'

13? Sed quo divitias] As to ‘ uo,’ see verse 56. We may supply
‘paras’ or some equivalent wor . ‘Phrenesis' seems to have been
horrowed from the Greek after Cicero's time. It was a general term
for insanity, while ‘ furor' commonly and in legal language meant
madness with violence.

138. φιηηι turqet sacculus] He begins with a small bag, and when
that is full he wants more. Instead of spending his fortune the man
invests it in farms. The ‘ villa ' here meant is a ‘ villa rustica,’ a farm
house, as opposed to ‘ villa urbana,' a suburban house. It- is equivalent
to ⁸ fundus, a farm and the buildings on it.

14⁵. Quorum si retio] It seems scarcely credible, but Juvenal
writes as if he had ad experience of what he was describing. After
⁴ talia' we must understand ‘ damna,’ or something like it. The
‘ injuria’ is a wrong like that just mentioned.

152. Sed qm· sermones ἱ] “ But what talk there will be! what a foul

blast will rumor blow!'’ “What harm can she do me'3'’ says the
other; “ I do not value at a bean-shell the praise of the whole neigh-
borhood, if 1 am to be owner of no more than a miserable little farm.’'
(That is, if they will only praise me on those terms.) For the con-
struction with ‘ quam si,' see A. 61, 1; Η. 506. It is an instance of
suppressed conclusion. “ of course then (is the rejoinder) you will
gain exemption from the sufferings of humanity, and have your life
prolonged and happier than you have ever known it, while you have
got as much land under cultivation as the Romans had in the time of
Tatius the Sabine king ; '’ that is, at the time when, according to the
received story, Tatius and the Sabines were inhabiting the Capitoline
and Quirinal hills, and Romulus the Palatino, and the two peoples
‘oined and became one under their respective kings. The extent of
and possessed by the Romans at that time, which represents the
earliest period of their history, must have been very small. The
‘ ager Romanus ’ at a period much later did not extend above five miles
from the l'omoerium (the enclosure of the city) towards the sea, and
the Romans had then no territory on the other side of the Tiber.
