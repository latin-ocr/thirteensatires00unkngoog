Prof. F. P. Nash, Hobart Colleqe, New York. —The charm of Mr. Sim·

Latin selectione. Being Speoimens of the Latin Language

and Literature from the earliest times to the end of the Classical
period. Edited by Professor Enmmw Η. SMITH, Hobart Col·
lege, N. Y. 12mo, 420 pages‚ 31.75.

Prot. Charles Chandler, Denison University, Granville, obia- Ι consider
the Selections to be an excellent and long-needed book. 1 shall use it
more or less every term from the beginning of Freshman year. For reading
at sight it is just the thing that 1 have wanted, and, in connection with the
study of the development of Roman Literature, such a book will be highly
interesting and profitable. I have always maintained that it is a flat, stale‚
and unprofitable task for the student to read about the productione of Latin
authors, without at the same time studying the productione themselves.

Prof. J. H. Hewitt, Williams Colleqe‚ Willz’amstown, Musa—The Selec-
tions have been made with discretion, not only in that they are interesting
in themselves, but in that they are such as to show the peculiarities of the
thought and style of the several writers. The book cannot fail to be useful
as a manual of exercises for translation at sight, and also as a text-book in
connection with instruction in the history of Latin literature.

Prof. Traey Peck, Yale Colleqe, New Haven, Coun. - The pian seems to
me to be carried out with excellent judgment and taste. This work cer-
tainly gives in succinet and atti-active form a clear view of Roman literature
throughout its best periodo
