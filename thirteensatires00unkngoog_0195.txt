enormous wealth, which he offered to the emperor as a gift at a time
when he knew that his enemies were successfully conspiring against
him. ’ Within four years of Nero’s accession he was said to have
amassed 300‚000 sestertia, which is nearly 812,000‚000. He was re-
turning from Campania, and had sto ped at his villa four miles from
Rome, when a tribune was sent by ero to obtain his answer to the
charge on which his life depended. The tribune entered while Seneca
was at dinner with his wife and two friends, having first placed a

round the house, which Juvenal here refers to. Plautius Late·
ratius, like Seneca, was put to death as a party to Piso's conspiracy

all three what is strictly true of Seneca alone.

19. arqente' vascula puri,] ‘Argentum purum’ is silver without any
figures or chasing.

23. Primasere vota] “ The first and most familiar prayers.'’ ‘ Opes '
here is simply wealth. ‘ Ut maxima toto nostra sit arca foro ' means
that each wishes to have the largest balance in his banker's hands.
The ‘ argentarii ' carried on their business in the forum. Those who
had considerable deposits with them, it appears, had each his own
cash-box. ‘ Ut ’ introduces an obJ’ect clause. See A. 70, 3, α; Η. 492, 3.

27. Setinum] ‘ Ardebit ' applies to the brightness of the wine, not
its s irit.

23. Jamne ἐρίων lauda-ej “Do you not after this think it well that of
the sages one,''' etc. The laugher was Democritus of Abdera; the
weeper, Heracleitus. The former fiourished at the beginning of the
fifth century ac. ; the latter a little earlier, at Ephesus. The enclitic
‘ ne ’ seems to be used in the sense of ‘ nonne,’ though the grammars
(H. 346, 11., 1, 1; Μ. 451, α; Ζ. 352) allow it only the meaning of
‘ num ' when added to any other word than the verb. See verse 90,
πὲΙιθτθ it is joined to the verb, and certainly seems to have the force
o ‘ num!

31. Sed facilis cuivis riye'de'] He says any one can laugh3 the only
wonder is where the weeper got all his tears. ‘ Rigidi cachinni ’ is a
hard sardonic laugh3 the genitive is appositional. See iii. 4, n.

35. Praetexta et trabam] As to these, which were the togas worn by
senators and magistrates, see viii. 259, n. He says in those cities in
which Democritus spent his time and his wit, there were none of the
great abuses of the present time, the iniquities and sels-indulgence of
the great and rich, and the corruption of justice.

36. Praetorem curribus altis] See viii. 194, n. He is giving a mock
description of the Ludi Circenses, which the praetor presided over.
These were preceded by a grand procession, in which the praetor rode
in a triumphal chariot with all the insignia of a triumph. What
follows is a description of a triumph. ⁴ Tunica J ovis ' was a tunic worn
only on triumpha! occasions3 it was kept in the Capitol, and had its
name fromshis. It was also called ‘ tunica palmata,' either because it '
was embroidered with palm branches, or because it had a stripe
(clavus) a palm in breadth. ‘Sarrana’ is Tyrian, that is ‘purpleff
