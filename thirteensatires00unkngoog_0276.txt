¹ THIS book has been accepted as a long step in advance of any

other edition of Caesar published in this country. Its great
superiority has been generally conceded‚ not only in regal-d to the
text, notes, and vocabulary, bnt also in the illustratione and other
features peculiarly its own.

The Gallio War, iu great part a story of battle and siege, is usually
the first connected reading of the Latin student. Its matter is no less
novel to him thau the language, each presenting numerous and pe·
culiar difficulties. The editor has aimed to meet the beginner‘s per
plexities at every point, — to supply in one volume all needful help on
forms or constructione, as well as· the varied information required to
make the study interesting and profitable. No undue prominence
has been given to any one feature: equal pains have been taken to
explain a point of syntax, or to describe the life of the Roman soldier:
to suggest an apt translation, or to set forth the character and purpose
of a strategio movement.

The Introduction, besides giving a fun review of Caesar's life and
character, with an estimato of his generalship, furnishes also a concise
and logical account of the Roman art of war in Caesar's time,the
organization of the army, the equipment and provisioning of t-he sol-
diers, the tactics of battle and siege, together with an outline of the
geography of the countries mentioned in the Gallic War. This esseu-
tial information‚ instead of being scattered through the noteS‚ is given
as one consecutive whole, each subject under its proper heading.
