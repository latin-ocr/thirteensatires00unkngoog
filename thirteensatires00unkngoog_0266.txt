bilis,’ is Greek ; the usual Latin would be ‘ gravius! gl‘he lengthening
of the short vowel before the two consonants (22) is not unco'mmon.

22. Diqnum erit erqo] “It is a proceeding then worthy of the rant-
ing Vagellius with his stupid hardihood, as long as you have two
sound legs, to provoke so many shoes, such thousands of hobnails.’
This is explained above on verse 14. Who Vagellius was is not

k ggnQaeeis tam procul absit] “ Besides this (he asks) who would come
so far from town, who is so fast a friend (such a Pylades) that he will
come out ιο the camp to give evidence for you ’ἑ We had better dry
up our tears forthwith‚ and not plague our friends who are sure to
make excuses, when the judge tells us we must bring witnesses.”
‘ Molem aggeris ' is referred to in x. 95, ·‘ castra domestica,” and
mentioned in v. 153, “ in aggere rodit‚’' and note. The praetorian camp
is here referred ιο. ‘ Tam procul ' therefore is ironical, for the camp
was not above a quarter of a mile from either of the two gates Collina
and Esquilina, north-east of the ci . A man must be a Pylades to
take such a walk for a friend, thoug the Agger which overlooked the

33. Contra paqanum pagis] ⁴ Paganus ’ after the time of Augustus
came to be applied to all civilians as opposed ιο military men. It may
have been first given them by soldiers in the way of contempt, for it
belongs properly ιο the country people. ‘ Pudorem ' is his honor,
which the soldier is supposed to prize more than the man of peace.
The word is so used in viii. 83.

36. Sacramentorum.] ‘ Sacramentum ’ was the soldier's oath which
he swore by the ‘ signa’ (standards), promising fidelity ιο his country
and his commender. The oath was administered on enlistment. It
is used here for military service, and is put in the plural number like
‘ stipendia‚' which means ‘ campaigns,' that is properly the number of
times a soldier has earned pay. So ‘ sacramenta ' would be the num·
ber of times he has taken the oath, which as long as he remained with
the army would ordinarily be only once, though there were cases in
which it was repeated.

Convallem ruris aviti] He says is any man robs him of his land,
removes his landmark, or denies his debts, he will have to go through
all the law’s delays before he can get justice, which is promptly ad-
ministered in campe. ‘ Convallis ' is said ιο be properly a valley sur-
rounded on all sides with hilis, and ‘ vallis ' one between two ranges.
The stone or other boundary by which private property was marked
off was sacred. The lands were in the first instance divided by the
Agrimensores with religious ceremonies, and offerings were annually
made close by them ιο the god Terminus, whose image was often no
more than a sha less stone. The neighbors met and offered sacrifice
