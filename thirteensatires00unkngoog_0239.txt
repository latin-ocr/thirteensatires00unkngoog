pected, a reference to the simplicity of the olden time, and there are
one or two pictures, as of the anxious host (59, sqq.) and the soldier-'s
family (166, sqq.), such as Juvenal sketches with peculiar power. 'l'he
satire belongs to about the same date as the preceding one.
Anouunnr. —There is many a disgracesul habit which parents
teach their children. What can you hope of the boy whose father is
a glutton or cruel to his household‘i what of the girl who cannot
count her mother’s paramours (1-30)3 Home examples corrupt most

whatever wrogg yogu do, your son will grow up like you3 and then
you will want to punish him for the very thing that you have done
(44-53). You cleanse your house when you expect guests; do you
not care that your son may see a spotless home ’ἐ The fiedged bird is
sure to seek the kind of food which its mother brought to the nest.
You waste money in building‚ he will do the same; you follow Jew-
ish customs‚ he will go to greater lengths in them (59-106). The
young are forced against their will to imitate avarice. They are de-
ceived by its garb of gravity and b the praise it gets. See how the
father trains his son in every sort ο stinginessl What madnessl As
money grows, the love of it grows too. So men resort to any means
to get more houses and wider flelds. Who cares what the world says?
We cannot be satisfieri with the way in which rustics lived years ago
107-188). Now you set your son to studying or to seeking the
onors of war—in fact, to getting money in any way. But you need
not be so anxious. The pupil will outstrip the teacher. His rich wife
will not live long. Nay, you yourseff, who have taught him to lie and
cheat, will not escape ; you had best buy antidotes soon (189-255). It
is as good as a play to see how men work for money. They sail over
the sea, running greater risks than the rope-dancer runs3 they do not
care for storms; they have to swim for life, and then perhaps to beg
(256-302). Diogenes was not afraid of a flre; Alexander learned
from him the foolishness of avarice and discontent. Get along with
as little as you can; Nature and Philosophy both bid you do this.
But ou will not be satisfled, unless you have as much as Croesus or
the ersian kings or our Emperor's favorite freedman (303-331). ⁴
1. Plurima sunt There are many habits which deserve to be evil
spoken of, and w ’ch fasten upon fair things a stain that will 'never
leave them. The fair things are the unspoilt minds of children.
These habits corrupt their minds‚ and get them bad repnte. ‘ Figere ⁹
and ‘ haerere ’ both express the lasting mischief these practices do.
‘ Monstrant traduntque is they not only show these practices in their
own conduct, but teach them to their children. ‘ Tradere ’ is a common
word for teaching. As to ‘alea,’ see xi. 176, n., and i. 88, n. The
kind of gaming here‘alluded to is explained in the next verse, where
