sArmn xv1. 251

40. 't non reddere nummos,] “ Persists in not restoring money de-
ffosit with him.'' This is the offence that gave occasion for S. xiii.

lie next line is repeated from the 137th of that satire.

42. qui lites inchoet annus] “ 1 must wait for some indefinite time that
shall even make a beginning of the causes of an entire people.'' So
Heinrich takes it, and 1 see no better way. ‘ Annus totius populi ' 1
can make no meaning of. ‘ Annus ' is probably a definite word for an
indefinite period. ⁴ lnchoare ' is commonly used for such a beginning
as is not brought to an end; and ‘ tunc quoque,' etc„ means that no
more than a beginning is made or likely to be made.

44. toties subsellia tantum] This means that the court was ready,
cushions on the seats, and everybody there, but the advocates loitered.
The case must therefore wait.

46. parati Diyredimur] This is the language of the amphitheatre.
“ Prepared to fight, we are ob ⁶ to separate, and the forum is but a
slow arena for our combat.’' ‘ alteus ' was a -belt which went over
the shoulder and held the sword. ‘ Suffiamine ’ is used in viii. 148
for a drag, and it is here used in that sense figuratively.

51. testandi militibus jus] Under the Roman law all that a son ac·
quired who was not free from his father’s power by emancipation or
death was acquired for his father, and he had no power of making a
will. About the time of Augustus an exception was made in favor of
money acquired through military service, which was called ‘ castrense
peculium.' Whatever a son had while he was ‘in patria potestate'
was ‘ peculium‚’ and with certain modificatione was held on the same
terms as a slave’s (iii. 189, n.). In the time of Constantine the
same privilege that attached to the ‘ castrense peculium,' or money
earned in military service, was extended to money earned in civll
offices, which was therefore called ‘ quasi castrense peculium.' This,
as Heinrich says, is an argument in favor of the satire having been
written before the time of Constantine, Am. 306. ‘ Non esse in corpore
census’ means that it was not part of the roperty which was under
his father’s control. ‘ Placuit' means only t at it is settled law. The
legal word for ‘ regimen ' is ‘potestas'

54. Enyo Gor-angam Siynorum comitem] Horace (S. ii. 5) refers to the
ἓὲξζηὲξ. ⁰¹¹ri-hlffli‘ssssz. {ffffifflssessssffiffiowfflvgaiessssfflessossterffi'afiss
this connection. This man, because he has got money of his own
which he has the power to dispose of, is courted by his own father,
trembling' with years, in hopes he may survive his rich son yet, and
get something by his will. ‘ Captare ' is the common word in this
sense.

⁵6. Hunc labor aequus] There is no sense in this. Some think
‘labor’ should be ‘ favor! This is the only coniectare that has thrown
light on the passage. ‘ Pulcro labori ' is the same as ‘ labore militiae '
above (verse 52). ‘ Hunc ' refers to the former ot the two persons, a
not uncommon usage.

58. ducis hoc referre videtur] This use of the genitive with ‘ referre '
is easily understood by resolving ‘ referre ' into its parts, ‘ rem ferre ; ’
