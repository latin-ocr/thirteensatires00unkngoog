224. οὸίίἕεῖο ιΞιιηαηι deducere] '¹ Obliquo ferro ’ is the carding instru-
ment, consisting of crooked bits of iron fastened in a board. ‘ Dedu-
oere ’ and ‘ trahere ’ are usual words for this process.

225. offecisse lucernas] Boys going to school at night carried lanterns
with them 3 the master had to bear the smell of as many lamps as
there were boys, and their books were black with the smoke. The
works of Horace came to be a class-book, as he soretold they would3
Virgil’s were thus used before his death.

228. quae coym‘tione tribuni] What authority for the administration
of justice the tribunus plebis had under the empire 1 do not know.
Under the republic he had none, directly at least.

229. Sed cos saevas He addresses the fathers= in an ironical vein.

233. Phoebi balmam] ‘ Balnea ’ were bathing·rooms or houses;
‘ thermae‚' large buildings intended for gymnastic exerc-ises, and also
supplied with hot water and vapor baths. Tho historical questions
these poor teachers are to answer are not unparalleled in some modern
examinations. Tho Scholiast thought he knew the name of Anchises’s
nurse, and says it was Tisiphone3 perhaps he jested. There was an
Archemorus also named Opheltes. His mother’s name was Eurydice,
and his father’s Lycurgus. He was king of Nemea, and in honor of
his son the Nemean Games were instituted. But Virgil speaks of
another. He was son of an Italian prince Rhoetum who married a
second wife named Casperia, and her step-son is said to have com·
mitted incest with her. Acestes is the Sicilian king who twice re-
ceived Aeneas hospitably. Virgil speaks of him as an old man, ‘⁴ aevi
maturus Acestes? The ‘ cadus ' was the same as the ‘ amphora‚' and
the ‘ am hora ’ was equal to two ‘ urnae,’ or nearly six gallonS.

237. stre‘yite ut moresl The poet has put as ironical advice to fathers
what they do without his advicc,· and the requirements contained in
verses 229-240 are what the man means when he says ‘ haec cures‚' as
if he had been recounting them to him. ‘Inquit‚’ ⁴ says he‚’ means
any father who has a boy in the school. If the master attends to all
these things, then at the end of the year he will get paid his fee, which
amounts to as much as a prize·fighter or such like gets in the circus or
amphitheatre. This the father tells him with much impudence, as if
that ought to satisfy him. Whether it was usual to pay the teacher’s
see annually or not 1 do not know, Horace s aks of its being paid

monthly on the Ides. But the prisictice must ave varied· in different
