93. anquam Caprearum] Capreae is an island forming a continuation·
of tho promontory of Surrentum and three miles distant from it. It
is about eleven miles in circumference, and precipimus on almost all
sides. One point of it rises 1600 feet above the sea. Augustus re·
tired to this place sometimes, and. Tiberius made it his retreat that
he might carry on his debaucheries uninterrupted, and be t'ree from
danger. The climate Tacitus describes as very pleasant in summer
and winter, and the prospect over the hay of Naples as beautiful.

94. Cum φερε Chaldaeo 5²] Tiberius towards the end of his lil'e was
much given to the astrologers‚ a pestilent race of impostors whom he
had before punished and forbidden the city. superstition and vice
grew upon him together ς a common case.

Vns certe pila, cohortes] He says, no doubt you like promotion,
and why should you not ’.ἱ He takes different grades of military rank
to illustrate his meaning. The steps are ‘ primipilus centurio,’ ‘prae-
fectus cohorti,’ ‘ eques egregius‚' aud ‘ raefectus praetorio.' As late
as the time of Polybius the infantry o a Roman legion were formed
into three bodies, ‘hastati,’ ‘principes,’ and ‘triarii,' or ‘pilani,' as
they were sometimes called, because they carried a pilum or short
javelin. Each ot· these divisions was subdivided into ⁸ manipuli,' and
the centurion of the first ‘manipulus' of the ‘triarii,’ who were
veteran troops, was called ‘ primipilus.' ‘ Pila ’ here stands for ‘ primi·
pili) [n. and after the time of Caesar the legion was divided into ten
cohorte, each of which consisted of three ‘ manipuli.' The commander
ot' a cohort was ‘praefectus.’ ‘ Equites egregii,' under the Empire,
were those who. had the fortune of a senator, or were entitled by their
position to hope for the Senate, aud these were allowed to wear the
‘latus clavus,' or broad stripe on the tunic, which was the mark of
senatorial rank. By ‘ domestica castra ' he means the command of the
‘praetoria cohors’ (see 61, note). These troops were quartered in
various parts of the city till Sejanus had command of them. when
tlhey were all placed in permanent quarters near the Agger of Servius

ullius.

‘ tanti’ for ‘tantum ; ’ it is then the genitive of value, and the con·
struction of the sentence is much simplified. ‘ Ut ¹ in either case
introduces a result.

100. An Fidenarum Gabiorumque See note on iii. 192: “ Simplici-
bus Gabiis.'' Fidenae was about ve miles north of Rome on the
Tiber. Ulubrae was in Latium, nearly thirty miles south-east of
Rome. ‘ Potestas ’ is the modern ‘ podesta,' ‘ authority.' ⁴ Vacuis ’ is
‘ em ty,' ‘ unfrequented,' as in iii. 2. As to the municipal aediles, see
iii. 1¹39. They were police magistrates, and looked after the market.
On great occasions, he says, a white tunic was a dress good enough for
them ; here he speaks of them as in rags.
