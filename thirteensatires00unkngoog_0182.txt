166 nome.

in Armenia, which was reduced to a Roman province by Trajan, and
to check the Parthians. The Batavi were a brave people, and werc
never strictly tributary tothe Romans. ln the years aa). 69, 70, they
carried on a sharp struggle for independence under a native chief
Civilis. They were at last put down. The satire, therefore, was
written after this war. ⁴ Aquilas ' is put for the army left after the

outbreak to prevent a recurrence of it.
53. &uncoque simillimas Hermae] This seems to have been prover·

bial. ‘ Hermae ⁹ were busts3 properly, but not necessarily, of Hermes
or Mercurius, which, like the GreekS, the Romans used to ornament
gardens, to mark boundaries, and for other purposes. ‘ Trunco ' only
means that it had no legs. It ended in a square column.

⁵6. Teucrorum prule-sd See note on i. 100, ‘Ipsos Troiugenas!
‘ Sic ' is ‘ on these conditions,’ and ‘ cui ' is equivalent to ‘ si illi!

63. Hir ἰιιὶ] Lipsius gives an inscription which he says he saw and
copied at me, b which it appears that Hirpinus was the son of
Aquilo, a celebra racer. The stone Lipsius describes was a curious
one. It had the figure of a man of the Red faction standing in the
middle, with a stick in his right hand and some hay in the left, and
two horses jumping upon him, one on each side; these are the sire
Aquilo and the son Hirpinus. The inscription on one side is AQmm
N. Aommnts vici-r cxxx. Sscuno. ‘tumr Lxxxvm. Tea. rnen·
xxxvii. On the other is Huu’nms N. Aouuoms vicu· cxnu.
Snounms ‘tumr nvi. Tam. τοι.. xxxvi. The other horse ‘ Corytha’
is unknown; in fact the roper spelling of the name is doubtful.

66. trito ducunt spire ια collo] They are put to draw with galled
neck ‘ epiredia,’ which were carts or harneas, it seems uncertain which.
‘ Nepos is the name of a baker. There were hand-mins and mills
turned by horses, or more commonly asses, which is the origin of the
term μὺλος ὀνικός, which occurs twice in the New Testament (Matt.
xviii. 6; Luke xvii. 2). On the use of ‘ versare ’ sor ‘qui versentur,’
see A. 65, 2,s; M. 363 obs. 1; B. 921.

68. primum aliquid (lul ‘ Da ' means ‘ tell me.' ‘Damus et dedimus,’

us roud, puffed up, and full of his re ationshi to Nero!

3. sensas oounmam‘s] This means a sense eld in common with
others. (See Horace, b. i. 3. 66, “ communi sensu larss caret.”) That
sense which is common property would naturali} escape the exclu-
sives. It implies a sympathy with mankind which the pride of birth
in the nature of the case prevents, and also a knowledge of character
and of the value of things only to be got through the eifferience of
common life and intercourse with raetical minds. In orace's in-
stance this common sense is what t e French call ‘ tact.' The man
there might be a worthy man, but he had a way of doing things out
