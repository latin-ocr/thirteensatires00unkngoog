SATIRE VIII.

Trm vice of aristocratic pretension is here represented with mode-
ration and good sense. There is no idle declamation against heredi·
tary honors3 but the blindness of men belonging to an exclusive class,
whose claims to distinction were founded upon the merits of the
great and good of former generations and unsupported by any personal
merits of their own, is shown in language to which no one can object
and reasoning which admits of no answer. The Satire is in the form
of a letter addressed to one Pontius. He is one of the class against
whose degenerate members the Satire is directed ; and we may sup-

ose he was a young man with what we should call good prospects.
g'he ride of birth and the degeneracy of inheritcd nobility were not
new eatures of society in Juvenal’s time, and they have not grown
so old in ours but that generations to come will complain as he did,
and pour contempt, as he did not, on the inheritance of noble names,
however virtuous their possessors may be. There are some severe
lines on the Emperor hero (21 1—230)‚ and the Satire was written
after his time, as the context shows3 but how long it is impossible to
say. Certain references to military movements and victories would
seem to place it a little later than Aa). 100.

Auentinum—Of what use are pedigrees and ancestral blood, is in
the face of our great ancestors we live amissi! Virtue alone is true
nobility (1-20). Names cannot change nature or make a man illustrious
(21-38). You take creditto yourself for your dement, and lace your·
self above the common herd. But in that rabble you will fin eloquence
and bravery‚ while you are useless (39-55). The horse is called noble
which wins in the race; if he cannot do this, he sells for little (ὃὸ-70).
1 would not have you valued on the merits of your family; it is a poor
thing to rest on another’s fame. Do your duty, ancl value not your
life before your character (71-86). When you get the charge of a
province, respect the rights of men and obey the laws. Those sub—
jects suffered less when they were first subdued ; peaceful governor-s
have spoiled them. But even they are careful not to touch those
whom they fear (87-124). If you and your favorites and your wife
are just, you may trace your birth to any source you please. But,
otherwise, your ancestors only make your shame the greater (125-1451.·
