6 Kekey’s Caesar.

John‘c. kosse, Hayloes Hiqh school, Cincinnati, ΟΙιίο. -- Kelsey's Caesar
is iu uae iu all cur 8188888, and is certainly 88 helpful 88 it is attractive.

Prof. H. S. Kritz, Waeml· Colleye, mefirdsville, quL— We are now
using nn edition of Caesar published last year. It was a great improvement
cn former edition„ but Kelaey's book,·vith its admirable arrangement of
matter, and many new and attractiva 1811111188, will, in my opinion, soon
take precedence of 811 others. We shall adopt it for the next 01888.

W. W. Orant, Princiml H‘tyk School, Indiaaapole‘s, I ndu—It neema ω me
decidedly the best edition of Caesar published for school use.

Geo. Η. Horswell, Northwestern Universe'ffl, Emuston, Ill.- It furnishes
every help that a student could desire. Ι 811811 adopt it with the next class.

Ptoi. Η. W. 1001181011, [uineis Colleye, Jacksonmve, Ill. —I have no hesi·
taticn in saying that it is the best aud handsomest edition of the most impor-
tant school author that 1188 appeared from the American prese Only a
few months ago 1 introduced a new edition, and, behold! that is already
antiquated.

John C. 618111, The Humani Sdml, Chimyn, Ill.—1t certainly seems
one of the most perfect school-books which 1 have seen.

Prot. J. H. Macmillan, Mam-touch Colleye, tto-mouth, Iu. —It is my ideal
of 8 text-book in plan and arrangement. The introductione and notes are
such 88 will lead ste student to investiyate5 and they show him that he ἰ8 deal· 4
ing, not with a driu-page of syntax, but with a subject which had wide influ-

ence over later days. Our next class will use Kelsey’s Caesar. ἶ

L. C. Hau, Principe! Heyh school, Detmit, Mica—It seems to me the 1
very best edition of our schoolboy’s friend. The introduction is unques-
tionably superior to anything of the kind in other editions; the maps are
placed where they should be, in the body of the text; the illustratione are γ
so good that they speak for themselves; the notes are helpful without
parading the impertinent erudition of the editor3 and the vocabulary is as
full as any of our pupils can use advantageously.

Prof. G. R. McDowell‚ Racine Colleye, We's. — It is the most atti-active ’
school-book 1 have seen, and 1 shall use itin my next class.

Ptof. Jas. F. Baton, Rv’pon college, Wis.—Prof. Kelsey has sui-passed
811 former editions of Caesar for school use. Besides the notes and vocabu-
lary, at least equal to those of any 011181· edition, the plates, the introduction,
the hints on the study ot Caesar, and, lastly, the table of idioms and phrases, Ἴ
make this invaluable for the beginner. ⁴ ¹

Prof. Andrew Stephenson. Upper lom Um’verse‘ty, Phycus, Im·-
1 have never used a text-book so entirely satisfactory 88 this.
