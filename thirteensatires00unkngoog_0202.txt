the Romans.. When Antiochus was defeated, m nc. 190, Hannibal
fied to Prusias, king of Bithynia. For seven or eight years he con-
tinued to be his guest, helping him in his wars, till the Romans finally
sent a demand for his surrender, which Prusias was not able to resist.
Hannibal, to avoid falling into the hands of the Romans, took poison,

ring ; therefore Juvenal says a ring was the avenger of Cannae (where
so many rings were taken from the bodies of the Roman knights), aud
of all the blood that Hannibal shed.
