Romans felt most and longest. The consuls defeated at Cannae were

the Romans and blindin them.

Tms is a letter to Corvinus, explaining to him the reason of the poet’s
rejoicing on the safe arrival of his friend Catullus, aster a stormy
voyage in which he had encountered the usual dangers and displayed
the usual amount of sear. There is some playfulness, though erhaps
