SATIRE vm. 165

30. qenerosum dixeri} ‘ Generosus ' as its derivation shows, belongs
properly to descent. ut, like εὐγενὴς, it came to have a wider sense.
A man might be ‘nobilis’ without being ⁸ generosus,’ the former
being nobility of personal distinction, the latter of patrician blood.
‘'ll'he {erb ‘est’ of the relative clause is to be supplied. See M.

79, o s.

32. Nanum cujusdam] In the later times of the republic and after·
wards it was the fashion for rich persons to have idiots, dwarfs, and
other deformities in their houses to amuse them. The former were
called ‘moriones ' or ‘fatui,' the latter ‘nani,’ ‘pumiliones,' or
‘ pumili.' They were of either sex. The practice has been continued

so there is not much difference.

38. netu sis Creticus aut Camerinus] Creticus was an agnomen of
the Caecilii Metelli first given to Q. Caecilius Metellae, who conducted
and brought to a successful conclusion the war with Crete, for which
he triumphed, 13.c. 62. The Caecilia gens was plebeian, but much
distinguished. Camerinus was the name of a good old family of the
patrician gens Sulpicia. Juvenal, after saying that things are called
by their opposites, advises his friend not to be called a Creticus
or Camerinus, for the inference would be that he was something
ve ow.

his mother Julia from Tiberius, whose son Drusus was Julia’s father.

Aa). 62. Juvenal makes use of his name robably without thinking
much about accuracy, and though the man iad been dead some years
he speaks of him as still alive. ()n ‘ feceris ' in verse 41, see A. 61, 1,
R.; Μ. 349 and obs.; Ζ. 572. ‘ Esses’ takes its tense from ‘feceris.’

42. Ut te conciperet] The man is as proud as if he had done some-
thing to deserve nobility‚ and to be born of a noble mother rather
than of a poor woman working for daily pay at the loom by the
‘ agger’ of Tullius, respecting which see note on v. 153. ‘Propter
quod ’ and ‘ ut ’ are parallel, each introducing a purpose.

46. Ast φο Cecropides! Εὐγὲνεια Κέκροπος was a proverb. The man
means he is of ro al bl , that is all.

49. Nobe'liffiin ti ,·] ‘Nobilis’ is not used as a substantive, and
‘ indocti’ does not agree with it as an adjective with a noun. It is
‘the nobleman who is unlearned,' as ‘jam veteres caecos ' in vii.
170 is ‘blind men who are quite old! ‘ Quiritem ’ is emphatic; he is
not only a man, but a Roman citizen, and worthy of being so. As to
‘plebe togata,' see i. 96. The poorer sort of people may have
been so called by the rich from their frequent appearance before
them in the ‘ toga,’ without which it was not respectful to go into the
presence of their patrous.

51. ρρτῐε Euphraten juvenis] ‘Juvenis ' is a man of fighting age, and
here it is used emphatically for a brave soldier. The 'state of the
East required the presence of a standing army to keep down rebellion
