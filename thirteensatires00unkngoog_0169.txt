62. satur-est quam dicit Horatius, anell The reference is to Hor. C.
ii. 19. 7. There is no doubt that Horace wrote all his odes after he
had got a competence; and if his poverty made him write in the first
instance, what he wrote then was of a different character.

64 dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque] Cirrha was situated at the head of the
bay called Sinus Crimisus, in the Corinthian Gulf. On the high
ground above it was the more ancient city of Orissa, of which it was
the port. Crissa was the original seat of the worship of Apollo, after-
wards transferred to Delphi in its neighborhood ; and in this way Cirrha
came to be associated with Apollo, who is the ‘ dominus Cirrhae ’ here
referred to. Nysa is a name given to several places where Bacchus
was worshipped, having originally belonged to that (wherever it was)
which reared him as a child. The locality of the original Nysa is
generally placed by the poets in the Punjaub. ‘ Feruntur,’ ‘ are carried
away, borne headlong ; ' the word is used for madness or (as here) in·
spiration or other strong excitement. ‘ Dominis ' seems best taken as
an ablative of means or instrumental case, as in i. 13.

66. lodice paranda Attonitae] ‘ Lodix' is a blanket or other bed-
covering. ‘Attonitae’ is used for ‘perplexed’ It is equivalent to
ἐμβμιιιὸντητος,,αιιᾰ represents one inspired. ‘Aspicere’ is in apposition
wit ‘ o us.

68. atulam confimdat Erinnys] This is Alecto, whom Juno moved
to inflame Turnus with jealousy when Latinus gave his daughter
Lavinia to Aeneas. See Virg. Aen. vii. 420, sqq. In vii. 450 he says,
‘⁴ geminos erexit- crinibus angues Verberaque insonuit rabidoque haec
addidit ore; '' and elsewhere from the top of a rock she sounds a
blast upon her horn at which the forests and rivers are startled,
mothers press their babes to their bosom, and all the country people
are roused to arms. All this roan-ing and snake-lifting the poet would
not have been able to invent if he had not been in easy circunistanceS,
if he had not had a slave or two and a pretty good house. virgil
had a good deal more than this.

69. tolerabile deesset] The verb must be pronounced in two syllables,
lgyiyinizzesis. For the tense, see Μ. 347, b, obs. 25 A. 59, 3, c; A. 8⁶

⁷1. 'Surda nihil qemoret {prave buccina] ‘ Surdus ’ is used for one (lumb
as well as deas. The ‘buccina' or ⁸ bucina’ was the oldest wind in-
strument, and was a ruder sort of ‘ cornu.’

'72 Rubrenus Lappa cothurnum} This is some small play-writer of tlte
day. He says we expect such a man as this, who is obliged to pawn
his dishes and his cloak while he is employed upon his play, to rise to
the dignity of the old tragedy.

⁷9. jaceat Lucanus in hortis] The poet M. Annaeus Lucanus inherited
a large fortune from his father, the brother of Seneca, who was a
native of Corduba in Hispania, and collector of the imperial revenues.
He is said to have died at the age of 26, Λα). 65, in consequence of
having taken part in Piso’s conspiracy against Nero. To avoid the
executioner he opened his own veins. He was therefore dead when
this satire was written. We know nothing of Serranus. Saleius is
mentioned by Tacitus as an unsuccessful writer.
