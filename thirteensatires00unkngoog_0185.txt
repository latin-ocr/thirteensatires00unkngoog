12’2. Fortibus et miset-ise] It is not well to do any great wrong to
those who are at once brave and poor (miseris), for if you take their
mone they will use their arms.

123. non est sententia.- He means it is not what we call a saw, a
commonplace. The ‘ Si yllini libri’ were writin of a prophetie or
oracular character, originally of great antiquity. ' he old books were
kept in the Capitol, and destroyed with the temple by fire, n.c. 83,
during Sulla's invasion of Italy. A collection was afterwards made
from various parts of the Roman dominions of writings professing ιο
be taken from the Sibylline books, and this new collection was de·
posited in the same temple when it was rebuilt. These sacred books
were placed by Augustus in the Palatine temple of Apollo. In con-
sulting th? books a leaf appears to have been taken at random, which
e ains t ie text.

. Sa· tibi sancta cohors comitum] ‘Cohors' and ‘comites' were
used for the personal staff of a governor. ‘ Tribunal vendit ' means
‘sells your Judgmentsss It is like ‘ suffragia vendimus ’ (x. 77).
⁶ Aoerseeomes: ακερσεκόμης (with hair unshorn), is Homer’s epithet for
Apollo, and here means a favorite boy kept for bad purposes.

128. si nullum in conjuqe crimem] In the time of the republic gover-
nors were not allowed to take their wives abroad with thern. Augustus
was very strict about this. But he himself took Livia with him on
more than one tour. Asterwards the practice became common. We
know stom the Evangelist St. Matthew that Pilate’s wife was with
him at Jerusalem.

129. Nec ' conventus] Every province was divided into districts,
in each of w ich there was a town where the governor going round
his province stopped and received all Roman citizens of that district
who came for justice or other business. These meetings were called
‘ conventus,’ and so also were the districts. Celaeno was one of the
harpies, and ‘ curvis unguibus ⁹ represents the Greek γαμψῶνυξ. Here
the wife is meant.

131. Tunc licata Pico] Picus was a son of Saturnus, and an early
mythical king of Italy. ‘Omnem Titanida pugnarn' is the same as
‘omnes Titanas pu atores ; ’ the figure is metonomy. They were
sons ot Barth, an Prometheus was one of them. The force of
‘ ipsum,’ Prometheus himself, is that he was reputed to have been the
creator of man. ‘Avus,' ‘proavus‚' ‘abavus,' ‘atavus,' ‘tritavus,’ is
the ascending scale, but each of these words is used generically for
ancestors.

136. Sa· frangis dryas] Seourging was practised only on those who
were not Roman citizens. There was a Lex Porcia which forbade any
citizen to be scourged. “Facinus est vincire civem Romanum ; scelus
verberare; prope parricidium necare; quid dicam in crucem tollere ’.ἱ
verbo satis digno tam nefaria res appellari nullo modo potest ’' (Cic. in
Verr. ii. 5. 66). ‘of this enormity Verres was guilty. The usual way
of putting to death was by beheading. The cross was confined to
