95. Ee phthisis et vomicae putres] ⁶ Consumption and putrid abscesses
and a broken leg ’ (xv. 57, n.).

96. Sunt tauta] ⁸ 'l‘anti' may be translated ‘³ are worth bearing,”
where we understand readily that they are worth bearing for the sake
of money. It may not be easy to extract this meaning from the sen-
tence grammatically, but Madvig (in his ⁴ Opuscula') has shown by
abundant examples that ‘ tanti,' which at first meant the worth of the
thing for which a price is given, came conventionally to be joined with
the price itself as here. An instance of the primary use ot· ‘ tanti ' is
found in iii. 54: “Tanti tibi non sit opaci Omnis arena Tagi—ut
somno careas.” Madvig refers to x. 97 2 “ Sed quae praeclara et pros·
pera tanti Ut rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum ’ἒ ” but 1 have fol-
lowed the common reading ‘ tantum ' there.

97. Nec dubitet Lada-sd Not even Ladas would hesitate to pray for
the rich man's gout, unless he is mad. There were two celebrated
Gmek runners of this name, which was proverbial in this line. Gout,
it appears, has always been the rich man's disorder. Archigenes was
a physician. . The final ‘ e' is long, corresponding to the Greek form
ᾗ. Anticyra was a town of PhociS, the neighborhood of which
abounded in hellebore, the supposed remedy for insanity. Horace
aliudes to it more than once. .

99. Pisaeae roenus olivae ἓ] The plain of Olympia, in which the
Olympio games were held, was very little west of the town of Pisa in
Elis, and the names are sometimes confounded. It was at these games
that both the Ladae on record won their prizes. His success cost one
of them his life. The branch of the olive which, as before mentioned,
,was used for the crowns at Olympia (viii. 226, n.)‚ Juvenal calls
‘ hungry ' because it bore no fruit.

100. Ut sit maqna tamen] “ But grant the wrath of heaven is great,
it certainly is slow,'' The speaker reverses the Greek proverb: “ Ὀψὲ

“ θεῶν ἀλέουσι μύλοι, ἀλέσυσι δὲ λεπτὰ.”

“ Thsolgglffthe mills of God grind slowly‚ yet they grind exceeding·

As to ‘ diadema,’ see viii. 259, n. It is not hard to find cases in point.
The Scholiast is safe and oes back as far as Romulus.

103. solet his {quase-ere. “ He is wont to pardon such faults as
these.'’ This is the common salve for conscience. Men make most
allowance for their own besetting sins, and think the Almighty does
so too· They think also they can get pardon whenever they please
for asking, and so they put off the asking3 and few think otherwise
than that their own day of account is some way off. To make a lot·
tery of wickedness, and trust to prizes turning up and risk the fatal
blank, is common enough. Solomon‚ who understood these matters,
says : “ Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil ”
(Eccles. viii. 11). When the heart is “trepidum formidine culpae,”
trembling with sear of its own great guilt, it would seem the shortest
and easiest course to abandon it3 but it is more convenient to argue
