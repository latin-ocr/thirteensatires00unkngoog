Ancora-nr. — Conscience convicts evil (iners, though the praetor
acquits them. You have the sympathy of your friends3 you can
afford to bear the loss; you are no worse off than many others. At
sixty years of age, has experieuce, as wise a teacher as philosophy,
taught you no better than to complain because a friend will not give
back a deposit (1-22 ’ἕ Good men are scarce now; we live in a bad
age; yet we call lou ly on the saith of gods and men (23-32). Yon
must be in your second childhood, to look for honesty now-a-days.
before gods were so plenty, in the 1good old times, dishouesty was a
prodigy‚ disrespect was a crime. ow
(33-70). 1 can tell you of those who have lost more than you, and
they who have stolen the money dcspise the gods and forswear them-
selves lustily (71-85). Some believe in chance3 others believe in the
gods, but will take punishment if they may keep their gains, or else
will run their chauces of escaping it ; meanwhile you shout at the gods
and charge them with being useless images (86-119). Now let an
unleamed man offer you consolation. 11 there never was so bad a
crime, then mourn as much as you like; but things are everywhere
the same3 you have no right to ask to be exce ted. Go to the prae-
fect's court3 spend a few days with him ς an then complain of your
loss, if you dare. No one wonders at the goitre in the Alps, or at blue
eyes in Germany, or at battles with the cranes in the land of the pyg-
mies (120-173). You say that perjury must be punished· Suppose
him put to death3 how much will you gain by that (174-179) ’.ἱ But,
you say, reven e is pleasauter than life. Chrysippus and Thales and
Socrates woul not say so. Philosophy correcte our faults; only
small minds care for revenge, as is evident from the fact that women
love it (180-192). But do they escape whom conscience lashes? They
suffer, as the Spartan suffered for only a wrong desire. The guilty
man finds no rest or comfort at meals or iu slee 3 he is afraid of
storms and of calma, and dreads discsse and ares not offer sac-
rifice3 the life of any victim is worth more than his (192-235). 'l‘he
wicked are chan ble ; but nature goes back to its own ways. Who
is ever content with a single crime? He will be caught some day
and suffer for it. You will confess at last that none of the gods is
either deaf or blind (236-249 .

ΣΙ.. Exemplo quodcunque mulo One sense of ‘exemplum ’ is a pattern
for imitation, and that which is done ‘ malo exemplo ' is a bad action not
fit to be imitated. ‘ Exemplo ’ is the ablative of quality, as it is called.

2. se Judioe nemo nocens absolvitur-‚1 These words appear to have
become proverbial.

4. Praetoris vicerit urna] In criminal trials a praetor usually prc-
sided. Juvenal says that the guilty man is his own judex, and is not
acquitted though corrupt influence may win, through the praetor's
lying um; he has a judex within whom no influeuce can corrupt.
⁴ Absolvo ' was the legal word for acquittal‚ represented by a tablet
with A. upon it. Each judex had two others, one marked C. (con-
demno) ancl the other marked N. L. (non liquet) which was an oren
verdict. ‘ Vincere ' is the technical word for winning a cause. See iv.
136, where it applies to a deliberation.

honesty is a mighty wonder
