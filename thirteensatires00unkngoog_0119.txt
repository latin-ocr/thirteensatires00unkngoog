and since paper must be spoilt, mercy would be thrown away ι Ι may
as well spoil it as others.” Sclioolboys will not want to be told what
‘ manum semdae subducere ' means; but it appears the commentatum
are not agree .

16. Consilium dedimus Sullae] The theme on which he professes to
have declaimed belongs to the order called ‘⁴ suasoriae orationes.'’ It
appears to have been a favorite subject. The advice is, that Sulla
should purchase sleep by laying down his power. He did s0, ac. 79,
and dieu next year in retirement. ‘Suasoriac’ were distinguished
from ‘controversiae,’ and belonged rather to boys’ schools. On the
case of ⁴ altum,' see A. 52, 3, a; H. 371, 1, 3, (2) ; Β. 713.

20. Auruncae flexit ‹damnusd Suessa, in Campania, the later capital
of the Aurunci, whose original town Aurunca (five miles from Suessa)
was destroyed by the Sidicini, was called Suessa Aurunca. It was
the birth-place of Lucilius. ‘ Placidi ’ is the nominative plural.

22. Illaeve'a Tuscum F02qat aprum] This refers to the ‘ venationes,’ or
fights with wild beasts at the circus and amphitheatres. The beasts
fought with each other, or with men trained for the tpurpose and
called ‘bestiarii.’ Of these many were free men an volunteers
fighting for pay, and among them were sometimes found women,
even those of equestrian and senatorial families‚ a thing which seems
to have happened first in the year Aa). 63, in the reign of Nero.
Domitian forced into the arena not only men of rank, but women also.
The practice was put down more than a century later by a senatus-
consultum, ΑΛ). 200, in the reign of Sept. Severus. 'Phe boars of
Etruria were particularly large. The women are said to hunt with
their breasts bare like the Amazons.

25. Qu> tondente] There was a barber, Licinus, mentioned hy
Horace, of whom the Scholiast says that he was made a senator by
C. Julius Caesar. There appears to have been some such story con·
nected with a low man of this name, for it passed into a proverb.

26. verna Canopi Crispiana] CanopuS‚ or CanobuS, which gave its
name to one of the branches of the Nile, was about fifteen miles from
Alexandria, and a town of dissolute moralS, as seaports are wont to
be. It is for this reason that Juvenal makes his upstart Crispinus a
native of Canopus. How he commended himself to Domitian, and
rose to be an eques, does not appear. ⁶ Verna’ was a slave born in
his master's house ε this man was therefore a ‘ libertinus.'

2⁷. Ίζᾳνίαε humero revocante lacernas‚] The ‘lacerna’ was a loose
cloak worn over the ‘toga' It was usually of costly dye and ma-
terial, being worn chiefly by the rich. The words describe the way
in which the cloak was worn, hitched up on the left shoulder by a
brooch or something of that sort, and floating in the wind, so that the
shoulder seems to pull it back. This man appears to have had light
rings for summer, and heavier for winter. 'l‘hat he wore a gold ring
does not prove that he was an eqneS, for by the emperors after Tiberius

the privilege was given to the lowest of the people.

iquities. '
