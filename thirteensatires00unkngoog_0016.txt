x LIFE OF JUVENAJ..

dangerous voyage, and is more of the nature of a familiar
letter than of a Satire. The dishonesty of the age is de-
scribed in the thirteenth Satire, which contains some of
J uvenal’s finest verses, and shows him in the best char-
acter. This also is in the form of an epistle to a friend,
and so is the eleventh‚ which contains an invitation to
dinner and contrasts the poet's own plainness of living
with the luxui-iotis habits of his contemporaries. Thus
Juvenal goes through all the great scandals of his day,
and treats them unsparingly. The crimes and criminals
of former reigns are freely introduced by way of illustra-
tion‚ but this is because the vices of one reign represented
those of another, and the names of the dead could be
more safely used than of the living. Tiberine, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all brought up from
time to time to point a moral or illustrate some aspect of
crime. .

The most celebrated of J uvenal’s poems, the tenth, has
more of the declamator-y character, which some of his
critics attribute to all. It is on the vanity of human
wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historical examples,
and the poem has not much bearing upon the particular
character of his times. It is the finest specimen of that
sort of composition that I am acquainted with. The
fifteenth Satire is connected with a scene of little general
interest, an Egyptian squabble, J uvenal’s own interest in
which can only be accounted for by his having been in the
country where it happened. The last Satire‚ if it had been
completed, would have furnished a sketch of military life, .
sarcastic but good-humored‚ from which a good deal of

’ information might have been derived.
