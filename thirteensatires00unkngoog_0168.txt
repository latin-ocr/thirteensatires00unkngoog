compositione in the porticos attached to the temples. Juvenal says
these misguided poets left the usual places ot· recitation to accept from
a shabby patron a dirty room and a packed audience.

inferior to omer only for the reverence due to his antiquity ; an , to
show that he has a poet's sympathies, he lends his poor brother a dirty

ents to sit at the end of the room an in different parts to applaud
him ; but he leaves him to go to the expense of hiring his own benches
and of the porterage. ⁴ Recites ' is used intransitively. For the form,
see A. 59, 5, ας Μ. 37ος Α. 8ο S. 261, R. 2. The same construction
occurs in verse 50.

du Haec lonyeserrata] The interpretem properly explain ‘longe ' as

46. pendent anabathra tiqe‘lloJ The room is supposed to be arranged
like a theatro, with ‘ subsellia,’ which are benches placed about the
room on the door, ‘ anabathra,’ or benches rising one above the other
at the sides of the room3 and an orchestra, reserved seats near the
speaker. The orchestra in a Greek theatro was the circular space iu
front of the stage occupied by tho chorus. In Roman theatres, which
nearly resembled the Greek, the orchestra was given up to the accom-
modation of senators and magistrates and other persons of distinction.
Herc the reciter put chairs for his more important auditors. ‘ Con-
ducto anabathra tigillo’ is equivalent to ‘conducta anabathra tigil-
laria,’ hired seats ot· plank. ‘ Posita est‚’ the orchestra is set out with
chairs.

than a bad habit, was applied medically to inveterate ulcers and

53. publica vena] ⁸ Publica' is, like κοινή, that which belongs to all,
commonplace; ‘expositum’ means such as you would meet with in
the highway, and so is ‘ triviale! In ‘vena' the metaphor is taken
from mines. ‘ Deducere ’ is commonly applied to verse-making, and

Juvenal speaks of the man whose ideas are not coined at the common
mint, in which all manner of base metal is struck, and then passes cur·

56. sentio tantum] He says he cannot point out such a person; he
can only imagine, or, as hc says better, feel him. ‘ Im atiena acerbi’
expresses ἄγευστος πικροῦ, not impatient, but free from t e suffering ot
bitterness, which is that of poverty, disappointment, mortification, and
seit-contempt. The Muses had their name Aonides from Boeotia,
anciently called Aonia. Bacchus and the Muses are always close
companions, and so he says ‘ thyrsum contingere.'
