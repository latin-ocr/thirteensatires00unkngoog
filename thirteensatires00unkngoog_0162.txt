fine barbels as well as the neighborhood of Corsica and other parts of
11ὲ8 Mare Etruscum. As to the costliness of these fish, see iv.
1 , n.

94. nostrum mare, This term, which originally had probably a lim·
ited sense, ultimate y signified all the Mediterranean. In this passage
the context shows that it has a very limited sense. Notice the con·
structifon of ‘ dum ’ with the present tense, as in i. 60 and iii. 10, where
see re erences.

97. provincia q The western part of Sicily was occupied by t-he
Romans at the c ose of the first Punic war, and formed their first prov-
ince. The whole island fell into the hands of the Romans in the second

98. Quod captator emat] ‘⁴ Fish for the fortune-humer to buy, and
his old lady to sell.'' These ‘ captatores,' or will-humere, are the sub-
ject of Horace’s fifth Satire, Lib. ii. Juvenal calls his ¹ captator '

one expects from 111111 1118 liberality of a Seneca, a Piso, or a Cotta,
sor in former times it was counted more noble to be generous than
great; all 11181 was wanted of him was to dine as a citizen, not as a

Nero's teacher, was unusually so. C. Piso is he who formed a con·
spiracy against Nero, for which he and Seneca lost their lives. Taci-

his money, and got a pension from Nero. The commentatore take
this for Juvenal's man.
