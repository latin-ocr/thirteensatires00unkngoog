of the illustrationis in the last line, the size of the people. They are
all one height, aud so they are not remarkable. Itis a curious thought.
Something that does not appear may have suggested it.

16¹7. Ad §abitas Thracum vomeres] These are the cranes, of which
Threiciae, Strymoniae, are perpetual epitheta. The home of the
pygmies is unknown. The cranes’ crooked talons have scandalized
some commentators. I dare say Juvenal believed they had talons. It
answered his purpose at any rate to represent them so, and he thought
nothing more about it. In the East the sudden appearance of clouds
of birds, no one can tell where from, when any rey is to be had. is
very surprising. This is expressed in ‘ subitas! he cry of the crane
is such that the flock may be heard very high up in the air after it
has assed out of sight.

, 1 2. Quanquam eadem assidue] For the subjunctive with ‘ quan-
quam‚’ see A. 61, 4, (15 H. 516,.1., ὃς Β. 1285. ⁷
1¹75. Abreptum crede hanc] This is the answer. “ Suppose he is
carried off to prison and put to death, what do you gain by that‘3”
By using ‘nostro’ he makes his friend's case his own.

178. sed corpore trunco] “ But all you'll get will be the odious eon-
solation of a very little blood shed from a headless corpse.'' ‘ At ' in
the next line is the common introduction to an obJ'ection or reply.

181. Nempe hoc indocti,l After ‘hoc‚’ ‘arbitrantur' or ‘dicunt' is
readily supplied. By ‘indocti’ the Roman writers commonly meant
those who had not become acquainted with the doctrines of the philo-
sopher-s. Equability of temper was a fundamental doctrine in the
'teaching of nearly all the schools, and nothing could be more opposed
to that teaching than the excitement of a passionate vindictiveness.

ῐΞΙῘ.184. Chrysippus non dicet idem Chrysippus succeeded Cleanthes,
the successor o Zen0‚ as the hea of the Stoic school. Reference is
made to him in Hor. S. ii. 3. Juvenal says above that he had never
read the Stoics’ works, and he probably takes Ch sippus’s name at
random. The legends of Thales were all inore or ess fabulous‚ and,
his rson being uncertain, his character is still more so. He belonged
to t ie Ionic school, and is said to have held that water was the sub-
stratum of all things. He is represented as having been very active
in political life, and to have directed his people, the Milesiam, in their
wars. As to the form of words, compare iv. 39. Socrates has been
mentioned in this way in vii. 206. There is no wat-rant for supposing
that his accuser wanted to destroy himself, and that Socrates refused
him a share of his poison. Juvenal says he would not have given him
a share if he had wanted it. ‘ Nollet ’ is used by a common construc-
tion for ‘noluisset.’ See A. 59, 3, c ; H. 486, 4. Horace calls him
