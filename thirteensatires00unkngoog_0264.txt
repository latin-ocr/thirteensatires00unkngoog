evidently could do well, would have been willing ιο leave the poem in
the condition in which we findit. There does not seem to be suffi-
cient reason for supposing the fragment to be spurious or for thinking
that the partial rejection of it in early times proceeded from any other
cause than its imperfect character. It is in the form of an epistle, and
professes ω set forth the advantages of military service, looking at it
as a young man might when tired of the restraints of a civilian’s
life.
Ausonum. — Ο Gallus, who can tell the advantages of lucky ser-
vice? First, no civilian dares assanlt yon3 and, if you beat him, he
dares not bring you before the praetor. He must refer his case to the
centurion ; and his revenge will be harder for him than the wrong; wit-
nesses will not dare to testify on his side (1-34). If a civilian has a
trouble with his neighbor, he has to wait for all the delays of the law ;
the soldier gets justice done him at once (35-50). Again, all that the
soldier earns is his own; his father has no control over it. The father
will court the successful son. For it is for the general’s interest that
the brave should be lucky and rewarded (51-60).

1. Quis numerare queat] The writer asks, “ Who can number the ad-
vantages of military service if it be successful ’ἐ As for that, if Ι can
join a fortunate legion, let me enlist and I shall count myself lucky.”
He speaks as a young man might speak of joining what is called by
our soldiersa crack regiment. and like some of our own tyros he can
think ot' nothing· more delightful. He is speaking sarcastically. Some
of the more distinguished legions bore names ot' honor, such as Victrix,
Felix, Adjutrix, and so forth. 'l'his is what he means by ‘prospera
castra.’ A soldier was a ‘ tiro ’ till he had seen service and was ac·
quainted with his duties. ‘ Pavidum ’ is here only a redundant
e ithet.

p4. sati valet hora ὀεηίῃηίᾸ This is Juvenal’s ironical style: having
mentioned a lucky star, he adds, “ for of course the moment osa smil-
ing fate is of more avail than a letter ot' recommendation to Mars from
his wife (or mistress) Venus or his mother Jun0.’' Juno’s worship at
Samos is well known. Her temple. the Heraeum, was on the coast,
and it is to the Samian shore that ‘ arena ' refers,
