of Styx (239—267). Add the danger from sherds thrown from the
windows (268-277); dangers from rowdies in search of adventures
(278—301) ; and dangers from burglars and banditti (302-314).

Umbricius begs Juvenal, whenever he visits his native Aquinum,
to send word to Cumae; and he promises to support his attempts ω
reform the age (315-322). ·

2. sedem ,ᾔρει-ε Cumis] The town of Cumae was not so much fre·
quented by the Romans as Baiae and the towns that lay within the
Sinus Cumanus (the bay of Naples). The supposed residence of the
Sibyl at Cumae was a large artificial cave which existed till the mid·
dle of the sixth century, when it was destroyed by Narses, the Roman
general who expelled the Goths from Italy. There are some remains
ot· such a cavern still, and it is supposed to have been the Sibyl's. (Jn
ῐὶιὲὅηιοοά of ‘destinet,' consult M. 357, a; A. 66, 1, <13 Η. 520; Β.

4. Jamm Baiarum] Cumae was about four miles north-west of
Baiae, and six from the headland of Misenum. It was not situated
on the pleasant bay (‘atnoeni secessus ¹) that bore its name, bnt the
Via Domitiana, which had lately been constructed, led to Cumae, from
whence there was an older road that led to the principal towns on the
bay, round which it passed to Surrentum, on the opposite promon-
tory. Hence it is called ‘janna Baiarum! Misenum, Bauli, Baiae,
Puteoli, Neapolis, were all favor-ite resorts of the wealthy Romans
. lying on this ‘ gratum littus‚' which was thickly studded with houses.
‘ Secessus ’ is the genitive of quality, or, perhaps, the genitive of ap-
position. .A. 50, 1,s; H. 396, v.; Z. 425; M. 286.

5. Eyo vel Prochytam] This is a small island (now called Procida)
of volcanic formation, lying between the island Aenaria and Cape
Misenum. It appears at that time to have been a lonely place, but it
is now well cultivated and populous. Suburra or Subura was the
‚name of a low street leading from the Esquiline to the Viminal. Juve-
,nal speaks of the town as if it was all one Suburra.

6. ιιι non Deterias credas] “that you would not think it‘worse to
shudder at fires,” etc. ‘ Ac ' means ‘ and, to be brief!

9. Aayusro recitantes mense poetas 5³] It was bad enough at any time3
but in August, the hottest mouth of the year, it might be reckonetl,
in a j0cular way, among “the thousand dangers of the barbarous
town.’'

10. rheda componitur una] The ‘ rheda ’ was a four-wheeled travel-
,ling carriage, such as Horace travelled in part of the way to Brun·
disium. For the use of the present tense, see note on i. 60.

11. veteres arctas madidamque Capenam] The ‘porta Capena' was

that from which the Via Appia began, in the southern quarter of the ,

city. It led to Capua, from which it probably got its name. The
Aqua Appia, the earliest aqueduct at Rome, constructed by the
Censor Appius who made the mad, was conducted on arches over
the Porta Capena, which is therefore called ‘ madida! The arches
which Juvenal calls ⁸ veteres ’ were about 400 years old at that time.
The figure of rhetoric in this clause is hendiadys. See i. 72, note.
