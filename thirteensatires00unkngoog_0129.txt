great men youwill suffer for it. Sophronius Tigellinus (whose name
is used proverbially) was Nero's chief favorite, and his accomplice in
the burning of Rome. The origin of the fire was traced to his house.
To avert from himself and his friend the odium of this crime, Ner0, as
is well known, charged it upon the Christians, who were put to death

torches. ‘ Taeda' here means either a pitched shirt, called below
‘tunica molesta ’ (viii. 235), or the pine wood with which they were
burnt. Juvenal represents the poor wretches with a stake thrust
under their chin. ,

155. 'Et'latum m’edia sulcum deducis] The variety of readings, and
still greater variety of conjectures, in ‘respect to ‘ deducis,' involve the
›assage in almost hopeless difficulty. It seems to mean: “ After you
liave been burned in the fire, you will be dragged through the midst
of the arena, making a broad furrOW.'’ The present for the future
represents the action as if now going on. Another explanation is
that the ‘sulcus' is a stream or gutter formed by the melted pitch
running off the man's body on the ground. Ι do not see how ‘ sulcus ’
can have that meaning. Madvig reads ‘ deducit,' and derives a nom-
inative (quae taeda) from what goes before. and then supposes the
furrow to be formed in the earth by a number of victims buried up to
their waists in a long row and set on fire. Some take the meaning
to be ploughin the sand and wasting labor.

31⁵8. Qui degit erqo] The satirist replies to the advice just given.
His friend speaks again in ‘ Quum — poenitet.’ ‘ Pensilibus plumis '
means a ‘ lectica’ with soft ieamer-bed and cushions, raised alost on
men’s shoulders.

162. Securus licet Aeneam] ‘ You may safely set Aeneas and Turnus
fighting; Achilles will not hurt you if you write of his death at the
hand of Paris; and Hylas isat the bottom of the well with his pitcher‚

and Hercules sought him long, sorrowing and calling upon his name,
and set the people of the country (Mysia) to seek him; a subject
much handled by the old poets. On the rhetorical figure in ‘ quae-
situs urnamque secutus,' see H. 704, 1v.‚ 2; A. ἃ, S. 323, 4, (2).

167. tacita sudant praecordia culpa] A cold sweat coming over the
heart through the power of conscience and the sear of exposure is a
forcible description. ‘ Praecordia ’ are the intestines rather than the
heart. In these passion and feeling had their seat, according to the
Romans ; the heart was the seat of intelligence.

169. ante tubas :l Before the battle is begun. When a man has put
on his annor, it is too late to draw back. The substance of his friend’s
advice is, that if he must write, he had better attack those who are
dead and gone3 and the poet says he will follow his advice.
