SATIRE XIV.

Tms satire contains some golden rules, and is throughout written in
J uvenal's best style. It exposes one of the radical causes of the pre-
vailing immorality, which was the contagious example and bad teach·
ing of parents, acting from their earliest years upon their children.
In a vicious home nothing but vice can be learnt, partly from the force
of infection, and partly because teaching cannot as a general rule rise
above practice, and he who parades his faults before hIs child cannot
even reprove that child if he adopts them. There is not a more preg-

more dignifled language than Juvenal has here used. It would have
been pleasant if his experience or the scope of his satire had admitted

of his drawing a picture of a home in which virtue grows by the same ο

means as vice grows by in others, and showing us how domestic
example and the influence of a happy home act on the characters of
men and the well-being of societjy. ⁸
The inherited vices of which uvenal speaks are gaming, luxui-nous
living, violence of temper, contempt for inferiors, sensuality, extrava-
