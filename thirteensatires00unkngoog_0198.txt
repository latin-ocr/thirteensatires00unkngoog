Notice that the condition denotes past time, and the conclusion present
time: ‘⁴ would now be hailing him Augustus.''

7⁷. ex quo su raqe’a nulli] ‘⁴ From the time we lest off selling votes ς ”
that is, since t e electione were transferred from the Comitia to the
Senate. See on viii. 212. The subject of ⁴ effudit curas’ is ‘ Turba
Remi ' (verse 73). lt means they have cast away all care about pub·
lic affairs ; all they now care for is their belly and the Circus. ‘ Panem '
is commonly referred to the public distribution of corn: but 1 think
that the remark ap lied to all, whether they were of the sort who
wanted the public ole or not.

81. Perituros audio multos] One says he hears many are to share
Sejanus’s fate, and another answers there is no doubt of it; there is a
great furnace ready (referring to verse 61). A· great many friends of
Sejanus, including his son and his daughter, a young girl, were put to
death soon after him.

83. ad Marte'sjue'e obvius aram] This altar of Mars was in the Cam·
pus Martius. There is a Brutidius Niger, whom Tacitus mentions as
aedile in A». 22, and as one of the accusers of Silanus. He may be
the person the speaker refers to as looking a little pale. Under the
character of Ajax, enraged with the leaders and the army for not tak-
ing his part against Ulysses, the man means Tiberius, who in his letter
to the Senate expressed great alarm, and begged them to send one of
the consuls with a guard to conduct him, a poor solitary old man, to their
presence. These apprehensione, whether real or pretended‚ thc Senate
might well sear would be visited on thern, and they hastened to remove
the cause of them, and everybody connected with him, with an alac·
rity which was to make amends for their implied remissness. This
was what Niger had to sear, and is clearly J uvenal's meaning.

87. Sed ta'deant serve] He says our slaves must see us do it, that
none of them may be able to say we did not, and give information
under which we shall be dragged with a rope about our necks to the
praetor. In the reign of Tiberius and afterwards the information of
slaves against their masters, which was illegal, was freely received
and obtained by torture. Nerva put a stop to the practice. and
checked informers generally. It was the common way of taking a
resistin culprit before the magistrate to put a rope round his neck.

. 88. i sermones] That is to say, what precedes. What follows is
addressed to the reader, who is asked it· he would like to have all the
power and honor that· Sejanus had. The curule officers, or those
entitled to the use of the ‘sella curulis,' were the consuls, censors,
praetore, and curule aediles. ‘ Summas ' does not mean the consulship
in particular; it applies to all. As to the nse οῖ’ · ne’ in ‘ visne,’ see
on verse 28. On ⁴ 111‘1 ’-‘ illum,’ see Z. 701, note.
