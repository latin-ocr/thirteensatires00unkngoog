sons ot delicate habits, who wore gold ornaments and had their wives
in common. Herodotus places them at the source ot the river Maris,
which flows into the Tibiscus, the largest tributary of the Ister. But
other writers place them further to the north-east, nearer to the Sauro-

dare vela phaselis] The ordinary river boats were built of the
, wood of the acanthus, and were propelled b oars and sails which were

made of byblus. These boats were painted¹ red, yeHow, or green, and

Θ Mollissima corda] Nothing can be more touching and manly than
the verses that follow. Their style is that of nature, and there is no
satire so strong as that which brings the pure emotions of nature into
conti-ast with the bad passions and vices of mankind. We come with
pleasant surprise upon a sentiment so true and simply expressed after
the revolting picture that has gone before. It is a satisfactionjo know
that this severe satirist could be tender when occas1on required, and
knew the worth of manl tears.
