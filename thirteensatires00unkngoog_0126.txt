· 110 NOTES.

the marshes in the neighborhood were famous for wild boars. Cor-
vinus was a cognomen of the Messalae, who were a branch of the
Valeria GenS, one of the oldest families in Rome. This gentlemarr of
old family is supposed to be reduced to keeping sheep as a 'merce-
narius.’ A person is said ‘ conducere rem faciendam,’ in which case he
receives pay (‘ merces ')‚ or ‘ conducere, rem utendam‚' in which case
he pays another for the thing used. ’

108. eqo possideo plus] That “possidere ’ was used generally in the
sense of possessing property, an not confined to the ‘possessores '
technically so called, is obvious from this and many passages. The
‘ possessores ’ of the republican period were occupiers of public lands;
and this man could not be a ⁴ possessor ' in that sense any more than
Pallas or Licinus. He makes himself out to be vastly rich, and yet
he is here begging.

109. Pallante e! Licinia] The man's speech ends here. Pallas was
a freedman of Claudius, in whose reign he got togethera large for·
tune, for the sake of which he was put to death by Nero, Am. 63.
Licinus was a Gauiish slave manumitted by C. Julius Caesar, and
made by Augustus governor of Gallia, which he robbed‚ and tliereby
grew very rich. The plural in ‘ Licinis ' is put, by a common usage,
for the singular. The grammars fail to notice it.

110. sacro nec cedat honori] The person of the ‘ tribunus plebis' was
inviolable‚ ⁶ sacrosanctus.’

111. pede'bus qui venerat albis 5] Slaves newly imported are said to
have been chalked on the soles of their feet when exposed for sale ;
''gt-What could have been the use of chalking their soles is not
o vious.

114. templo] The intransitive use of the verb ‘habito ' is more com·
mon than the transitive.' The temple of Pax was one of the hand-
somest buildings in Rome, and was situated on the Via Sacra. It
was begun by Claudius and finished by Vespasian‚ who deposited in
it the spoils of Jerusalem brought to Rome by Titus. It was burnt
down in the reign of Commodus, about 120 years after it was built.
Fides had a temple on Mons Capitolinus, which was said to have
been founded originally by Numa, and was afterwards restored in
the consulship of M. Aemilius Scaurus, 1³.c. 115. No less than three
temples of Victoria are mentioned, one of which was in the forum,
another on Mons Palatinus, and a third on Mons Aventinus. In his<
first consulship M. Marcellus built a temple to Virtus near the Porta
Capena, from which the Via Appia began.

116. crepitat Concordia nida] “ Concordia, who twitters when vo-
taries salute the nest 3 ’² that 1s, her temple sounds with the twittering
ot' the birds. · Mayor translates: ‘⁴ who elatters when she visits her
nest.’' The birds and the goddess, he says, are identified. There
was a beautiful temple to Concordia in the Carinae, originally built
by Furius Camillus after the expulsion of the Gauls, 1³.c. 390, and
restored by Livia, Augustus's wife. There was another that stood
between the Capitol and the Forum, in which the senate sometimes

held its meetings. Some say that the crow, others that the stork,
was the bird sacred to Concordia.
