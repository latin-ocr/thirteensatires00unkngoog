141. Qui tu qdlinaefllius albae,] The eggs of a white hen, it ,
were held in higher estimation than others. The bird must have been
more or less rare, or the distinction would not have arisen. ‘ Qui ’ is
' how.' The apodosis for ⁴ si flectas ' seems better supplied from
⁴ serendam ’ than from ⁴ pateris)

145. sulfure coepta Atque dolo‚] ‘ Sulfure atque dolo' is one subject,
‘ sulfure doloso ’ or ‘ cum dolo posito,' sulphur stealthily laid, matches
pean ‚⁸ ffissssffissawssmffl iqnes t] These incendiary acts seem to have
been not uncommon. Aecidental or malicious fires were so frequent
that they are counted among the vexatione of the city stom which thc
inan in Sat. iii. chose to retire (verse 7). Nero plundered the temple
at Delphi, and it is possible Juvenal had him in mind in the next
c s .

¹323. minor exstat sacr-{leque qni Radat] ‘ There starts up a petty thies
to serape the thigh of a gilt Hercules! This is the subjunctive of the

stands. He says, compare with your man those who carry off great
venerable cups from temples. Is these are not to be found, then
eomes a thies in a lower way, to serape the gilding from the statues.
Would he hesitate‚ seeing it is his wont to melt down an entire Jove ’Ξ
‘ Solitus ' must be wrong, 1 think.

154. mercatoremque vene-nl] ‘ Mercatorem’ is equivalent to ‘empto-

(viii. 213, n.). Though ‘ parricidium ' included the murder of relations
to some distance in point of consanguinity, this punishment only
applied to the murderers of father or mother, grandfather or grand-
mother. ‘ Fatis ' is the ablativo of quality.

15¹7. custos Gallicus Urbis] Rutilius Gallicus was Praefectus Urbi in
the reign of Domitian. Respecting that office, see iv. 77, n. ⁴ Ibi ' is
readily supplied with ‘consume ’ from ‘ illinc ' in the next verse. As

by medical men as bronchocele: The sufferers were called ‘ guttu-
rosi.' As to the swelled breast in Meroe nothing is known. Some
commentatore suppose Juvenal speaks from observation during his
residence in Egypt. Tacitus says of the Germane that they all had
fierce blue eyes, red (or golden) hair, and large bodies. ⁴ Germanum ’

166. Nempe quod haec i is] ‘ Nempe quod ⁹ assumes that the answer
