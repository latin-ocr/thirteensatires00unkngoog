ΒΑΤΙΒΕ 111. 123

is used to express a totally different relation between tron and de-
pendent from what it expressed in the earlier times ο the republic.
At this time⁴ it did not involve a legal and political distinction, and
meant no more than a humble friend, a dependent who looked to
another for support, counsel‚ and so forth. ‘ «Iacturam facere ' is to
throw a thing away so as to save the rest. It is an expression bor·
rowed from nautical language. ‘ To throw a person overboard ' is a
common conversational phrase with us, meaning to get rid of him.
on ‘perierunt,' consult A. 58, 5, a ; 11. 471, 1; B. 1095. .

126. Quod ρον-νο officium] He here enters upon a subject we have
had before (i. 101). ‘ Porro’ means ‘ to proceed,’ ‘in the next place!
‘Ne nobis blandiar’ is another way of saying ‘to speak the truth.’
‘ δί’ has the sense of ‘even if? There were at tlns time eighteen
praetors in the city3 · Each praetor had two lictors allowed him. ⁹ ‘Ire
{affliefflffifflz ὦὲἓῖἑὲἓὲοὲζ’ἰῖἓῗῗὲῗιζὲἓέῑῗέἱίὶ.. θῦἓῖἷωίἶὲἰ
means to say these rich ladies have long been up waiting for their
visitors, and the praetor is in a fright lest one of his colleagues should
get to the house before him.

131. Divitis Ιιὶο servi] ‘ Claudere latus ’ means in effect to give the
wall to a man with whom you are walking. See Horace, S. ii. 5. 17.
The ‘ servus ’ is now a freedman, and the young gentleman is glad to
wait upon him. ‘ Ingenuus ' is one born of free parents. ⁸ Alter'
means the freedman, and what follows is only a way of saying he was
very rich and could indulge himself as he pleased.

132. quantum in leyione tribuni Accipiuntl] It does not appear what

the pay of a tribune was, but we may conc ude from this passage that
it was not a small sum compared with prices in these times.

133. Calvinae vel Catienae,] These represent women of birth.

135. vestitifacies scorti] She in pursuit of her trade would appear
in a showy dress, carried about in a chair (i. 65, n.), to invite and
be inspected by customers. Or else she sat in a chair in her house,
and those who came in to admire must pay her well before she would
get down. To invite her from her sella, whichever it was, would be
the same as to consent to her price.

137. Da testem Romae] He goes on to say honest poor men are not
believed at Rome on their oath. By the host of the Idaean divinity,
Cybele, he means P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, who for his great merits
was chosen by the senate to escort the image of that goddess, which
was brought from Pessinus to Rome 13.c. 204. Numa was the most

ious of the kings. L. Caecilius Metellus, who triumphed during the
first Punic war, who was twice consul, once magister equitum, dic-
tator, and for twenty-two years Pontifex Maximus, shortly after he
was chosen to be Pontifex rescued the palladium from the temple of
Vesta when that was on fire. He lost his sight on that occasion. The
Romans professed to have in the temple of Vesta the original Trojan
