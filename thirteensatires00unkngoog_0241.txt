SATIRE xiv. 225

‘ agctoribusl see viii. 216, “ deis auctoribus,'’ ‘ on the authority of the
ο s.' .

g 35. finxit praecordia Titan ,·] That is, Prometheus. See viii. 133, n.

He says some few young men may reject these examples, who are

made of better stuff than others, but the rest follow in their fathers'

steps which they ought to avoid, and the track of vice which has been

long before their eyes. ‘ Orbita ’ is properly the track of a wheel.

38. hujus enim vel] ‘Hujus’ depends upon ‘potens:’ there is one
reason even if there were but one, ‘ vel una ') that commands this.

41. urpibus ac pravis] Both these words are applied to the human
shape, and they may be here translated as they come together ‘ ugly
and deformed! ‘Pravus’ is ‘ awry.'

42. quocunque sub axe ,· See viii. 116, n. on ‘⁶ Gallicus axis,'' and xiii.
89, as to ‘ quocunque.' e says a Catiline ou may find in any clime,
a Brutus οι· a Cato nowhere. Μ. Porcius ato of Utica was the halt·-
brother of Servilia, mother of M. Junius Brutus, the murderer of
Caesar. These two men bear no comparison in point of character. It
was enough for Juvenal and those who thought and felt with him that
they were bot-h opponents of Caesar and reputed friends of liberty.
Cato was a man ot' rigid virtue and a suitable example for this place.
Brutus had less that was noble in his private character. Juvenal does
not always select his examples very fitly. Catilina was as depraved
in private as in public life, and his dissolute morals and extravagance
led him into those desperate acts that cost him and his friends their
lives. Cato's parents both died when he was a child, and in this
matter the examples are not well chosen. The father of Brutus was a
,respectable man, though of his mother much scandal was spread in
connection with C. Julius Caesar.

44. Nil dictu foedum] This means ‘ foul language.’ ‘ Auditu ' would
be more in accordance with ‘ visu ’ and the sense. ‘ Hinc —inde ' is
equivalent to ‘ubique.’ ‘Puellae lenonum' are ‘meretrices’ ‘ Per-
noctantis parasiti ’ is the contemptible guest who for a dinner sits up
all night drinking or gaming or both, and singing low songs, with the
master of the house, to his shame before the children. ‘Pernoctare '
is to pass the night away from home.

48. ne tu pueri contempseris annos‚] “Do not despise the child's age
or think he is too young to take notice :'’ an excellent remark, as
every parent knows. ‘ Tu ’ is commonl used to give point to a.
general piece of advice. Com are M. 37 , obs. 2. On the use of the
tgnffi 1¹2 ‘contempseris,’ see NP. 3863 A. 57, 3 and ὂς Η. 488, 11., 23

⁵1. Quam! e] ‘ Quandoque ' after ‘ si’ is like ‘olim,’ ‘aliquando,’
‘ some day.' ee M. 493, α; Ζ. 708. He says “if your boy some day
does something worthy of the censor's displeasure, and not only
shows himself like you in form and face, but as the son and inheritor
of your character and one to follow in your steps and exaggerate all

our faults, then of course you will take him up and reproach him
ssudfflnd bitterly and threaten to alter your will.'’ He speaks sar-
casti y.
