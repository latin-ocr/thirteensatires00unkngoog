SATIRE v. 141

'Iuvenal's conclusion is, that they who will put up with such treatment

desei-ve it; and the rich man is not much to blame if he despises those

who are only drawn toliis table by the nose, that is, by the savor ot

his kitchen. η

The satire has its moral for modern society, in which, if the relation
of host and guest is prevented by good breeding from taking the form
here represented, eating and servility are scarcely less prominent
features than they were at Rome in its worst days. If the rich look
down upon the poor, it is usually because ot' the homage rank and
riches meet with, and that this homage comes of selfishness none
know better than those who receive it. The coveting of what is called
good society is the vice of a rotten system; and the man who seeks
company which does not want him has no reason to complain if his
pride is galled and his ex tations are disappointed. If there were
no Trebiuses in the wor d there would be uo Virros3 so Juvenal

giloughn and he does well to lay the chief weight of his satire upon

e arasite.

of a nch man, or of as many rich men as he could get attached to in
that mean capacity. The old relation of ‘ patronus ’ and ⁴ cliens,' so
far as we can understand it, was simple and natural. The other was
the mere refuge of poverty, prefert-ing the bread of idleness and a
false tongue to a life of honest labor and the rewards of an indepen-
dent mind. The student will only be misled if, following some of the
commentators, he looks upon the latter condition as but another
phase of the former. Thc old institution died out with the republic
to which it belonged; the modern practice was the fruit of human
corru tion, mdd has its analogies in all ages of society, such as is
call civilize .

Ancona-nr. —Men of honor, Trebius, would choose be rather ·
than such dependence as yours (1-11). For, first, when nrro invites
you to his board, he thinks that he has repaid you for all your semces
(12-23). Then, at dinner, you are served with poor wine which incites
you to quarrelling3 he has the very best (24-37). Virro’s cups are
J‘ewelled3 you are hardly trusted with any thing but glass3 and ou do
not even drink the s'ame water (37-58). You are waited on by a oorish
runner; he, by a fair youth of Ionia (53-66). You must gnaw mouldy
bread, and not presume to touch Virro's loaf. This is all your reward
(67-79). Virro s fish are the choicest, yours the poorest (so—106).
Virro’s unsocial arrogance, too, is worthy of a passing rebuke (2⁰⁷-
113). While dainties are carved for the host, you must look quietly
on (114-131). You would be differently treated if you were wealthy
and childless (132-145). The mushrooms and fruits offered to you
differ from those which he has (146-155), He does all this on purpose
to mortify you3 and you deserve to be treated like a slave, for such
you have made oursels (156-173). , ⁷
