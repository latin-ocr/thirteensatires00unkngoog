beaten he commonly held up his hand to the spectators to plead for
his life, which depended upon their caprice.

20⁷. Credamus tunicae, We may know it is Gracchus by his tunic,
and the strings (spira) o his cap, which, as well as the tunic, were
embroidered with gold. It appears from this that Gracchus was one
of the priests of Mars, who wore tunics and caps of this kind.
‘ Secutor' was another kind of gladiator, who was usually matched
with the ‘ retiarius! ‘ Ergo ³ means, since then heis well known to
be but a priest, the '‘secutor’ will only be disgraced by such an

. 222. genscum prae erre Neroni 2] Tacitus says thatin the conspiracy
against Nero head by Piso (11.1). 65), 301110 of the principal conspira-
tors agreed that, after. the tyrant was killed, Piso should also be put
out of the way, and the empire offered to Seneca, who had been tutor
to Nem, but had fallen under his suspicion. The conspiracy was
discovered, and Seneca was charged with being a party to it, and put
to death with several others. Tiberius, two years after 110 became
emperor, put an end to the little influence for elections that Augustus
left the comitia of the centuries. See Tac. Ann. i. 15.

213. Cujus sup licio] The punishment for ‘ parricidium ⁹ from very
early times was t at the criminal be scourged, and sewn up in a sack
with a dog, a cock‚ a snake, and a monkey, and thrown into the sea.
Juvenal says that Nero deserved this many times over. He put to
death 1113 mother Agrippina at the instigation of 1113 mistress Poppaea
Sabina, Am. 69. Three years afterwards he divorced, banished‚ and
murdered his wife Octavia, and having married Poppaea killed her in
a fit of rage. He also caused ιο be put to death, because she would
not marry him, Antonia, his sister by adoption, being the daughter of
Claudius, who adopted Nero and made him his heir, to the exclusion
of his own son Britannicus, whose death Nero effected by the hands
of Locusta, having before been a party to the murder of his father
Claudius, contrived by his mother Agrippina. Besides BritannicuS,
Nero poisoned his sather’s sister Domitia for her money. All this
he says was worse than any thing Orestes did. He put 1113 mother
clytemnestra to death, but he did it by the order of Apollo, to revengc
his father's murder. He did not murder his sister Electra, nor his
wilge ‘Hermione (daughter of Menelaus and Helen), nor poison his
ηέὅῖωὲαηρνίπε conjugii 52¹ This is used for ‘ conjugis: by a common
trope. Nero went upon t e stage first at Naples, where he appeared
several times. He is said to have written a poem on the burnin of
Troy. Dion Cassius mentions the poem, which Suetonius says ero
recited while Rome was hurning, lookin out from a tower and
admit-ing the heaut of the flames. See ac. Ann. xv. 39.

221. Quid enim erye’nins armis] He asks which of all Nero's crimes
so called for punishment as his havin written this dull poem. L. Ver-
