cular couches were introduced, with fewer people on them. In large
houses there would bc several of these in a room. Seneca had five

139. Nullus jam parasitus erit .·] ‘ We shall soon have no parasites3
but who shall bear to see this selflsh gluttony of yours ’.ἱ ’ He addresses
the man. ‘Luxuriae sordes' means avarice and luxury combined.
‘ Ponere ' is the word used for putting dishes on the table. At large

149. Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit. ‘⁶ All vice is at its height ”
(Stapylton). ‘⁴ All vice is at its zenith '’ (Gifford). “All vice is at
