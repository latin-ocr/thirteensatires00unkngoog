SATIRE 1.

Tms satire must have been published atter Am. 100 (see note on
verse 47 . Whether it was written first or not, it serves very well as
an intr uction to the volume. The ‘libellus’ of which the author
speaks (verse 86) ma be this poem or the whole collection.

Aaouumwe-Am always to listen, and never to pay back in kind ’ἒ
1, too, have been to school; if paper must be wasted, why should not
1 write (1-18) ’ἓ How can Ι resti-ain m sels when 1 think of the men
and the times? 1 have no choice3 must write satire. How, in
-view of the sins of to·day, can Ι take up the hackneyed tales of the
old poete? In the very streets one sees his material. Honesty is
gone3 crimes alone help men. Ι must write as Ι can (19-80). All
the passione of men are my motley subject. When was there so
much gaming as there is to·day‚ such luxury, such base cringing for a
-paltry gain ’.ἱ Why, even men of rank seek the dole and prees their
claim in every way (el-126). So, every day, the sportula comes
first, then the court3 then the hungry clients go away disappointed,
and the rich man sits down to his feast. But such gluttony brings its
own speedy punishment (127-146). You tell me Ι had best be carc-
ful how 1 speak‚ or Ι may meet the Christians’ fate; that it is safer
to write of those who are dead and gone. well, then, 1 must try
what 1 can do with those who are in their tombs (147-171).

1. Semper syo auditor tantum ?] In the time of Augustus it had bc-
come common for all sorts of writers, but particularly poete, to recite
their productione in public places, baths, colonnades‚ and so forth ; or
to get their friends and aeq uaintances together to hear them in private
houses or rooms hired for the purpose. The practice was adopted by
litei-ary men of character as well as the inferior sort3 the example
having been first set, as is said, by Asinius Pollio, the friend and pa·
tron of Horace. See vii.· 82. ‘ Tantum' modifies ‘auditor.' A. 47,
3, c; H. 583, 1; Β. 997; Μ. 301, c, obs. 2. . ‘ Nunquamne reponam '
means ‘Am Ι never to pay back? ’ The verb is the present sub-
junctive. A. 57, ὃς Η. 486, 11.; B. 1180.
