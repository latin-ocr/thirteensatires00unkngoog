Lucretim3 De Rerum Natura Libri Sex. With an Introduc·
tion and Notes to Books 1.‚ 111„ and V„ by FRAncrs W. KaLsnY,
M. A„ Professor of Latin in Lake Forest University. 16m0,

444 pageS, 3157 5.

Prof. Saml. Hart, Trinity Colleqe, Hargfbrd. —It is a most excellent edi·
tion, and, coming at a time when renewed interest is felt in the doctrines
and writings of Lucretius, its publication meets a real want.

Prof. C. J. Harris, Washinyton and Lee University, Va. —It is an admi-
rable edition, and will be thoroughly helpsul in the difficult work of devel-
oping the school-buy into the scholar. The editor has caught much of the
enthusiasm of his author, and the wide and varied reading which he has
brought to bear upon his work, and his freshness and vigor of treatment,
cannot but prove very stimulating to earnest and ambitione studente.

Prof. L. S. Potwin, Adelbert Colleye, Οἰευείαηά, 0. -Ῑ like it much, and
think it not only well annotated, but also prepared on the true theory,
viz.: to give the whole text, and notes on a part. This gives a chance for
independent study on a portion, and practice in reading at sight.

and Conington, by the Rev. Samum ΗΑΒΤ, Μ.Α., Professor in
Trinity College, Hartford. 16m0, 91 pageS, ὓΟΠὸ.

The text of this edition agrees in most places with that of Jahn. In the
arguments prefixed to each satire, the editor has endeavored to give a
suggestive outline of the poet's thoughts, and in the notes, to point out as
clearly as possible the connection of one idea, or one part of the poem, with
another.

edition os any play of Plautus.

Prof. A. G. Hopkins, Hamilton college, New York.—Your edition of
the Mostellaria by Mortis is elegant in appearance, and has a scholarly
finish to it which no American edition of Plautus has hitherto shown. The
Introduction is full and interesting; the text is a model of typographica!
beauty; and the notes explain to the young student all the difficulties and
