‘cucurbita' is called ‘ventosa’ from ignorance of the principle on
which it acts, as the word ‘ventosa’ was used alone for ι cupping÷
glus in mediaevsl latin. A purtial vacuum is created in the. cup,
which being so applied to any part of the bod removes the pressure
of the air from thet spot and causes a rusb of b ood to it. The anciente

outside the house. Perhaps, however, he means the ‘ peristylium ⁹ or
else the gallen-ies on each side of the ‘impluvium' In any case it
was open to the weather. The plural ‘ atria is commonly used by the
poets for the convenience of their νει-θος but as the room had two
wings (ulae) opening upon it, and the whole formed oue sperauerit,
tlte plural is not without meaning. This being the most public room
