‘ Armaria ⁹ were cupboards or cases, usually for books, standing against
the walls, as opposed to ‘ capsae ’ and ‘ scrinia.' which were boxes also
used for books. ‘ Cista ’ was any box, large or small. It was sometimes
big enough to hold a man, though be had to squeeze to get into it. '

12. Atestinae„ Pacem Alcithoe was the Boeotian woman, daughter ot·
Minyas of Orchomenus, who refused to celebrate the rites of Diony-
sus, and was changed by him into a bat, together with her sister
Leuconoe. The writer refers, no doubt, to tragedies by living writers,
whether Paccius and Faustus were their real names or not. Thebes
under a hundred forms gave subjecta for the stage; and there are
fragments of a play by Sophocles founded upon the story of Tereus
and the two sisters Procne and Philomela.

14. saciant equites Asiani,] Knights from (proconsular) Asia, Cappa-
docia, Bithynia, and Galatia (altera Gallia), are slaves who have made
equestrian fortunes. Galatia, or Gallograecia, got its name from the
Galli, who in the year ac. 278 came over from B zantium to help
Nicomedes 1. to get the kingdom of Bithynia. e gave them the
neigliboring country, which was called after them. ⁸ Nudo talo ' may
be compared with ‘ pedibus albis' (i. 111), though 1 am not sure that
the usual interpretation there is right. ‘ Traducit’ means ‘ puts for-
ward to view! Tho first syllable of ⁴ Bithyni ’ is elsewhere long.

1⁷. Nemo tamen ιιαᾰὶιέὲι He says no poet henceforth need follow any
unbecoming business. e describes the poet as one who joins the
eloquence of words with the harmonies of music, and has eateu the
bay, that is, the ⁸ laurea Apollinaris.’

20. Hoc ayite,] This is a formula which occurs in Horace (Epp. i.
6. 30): “ Set about it; lose no time.’' Juvenal calls Domitian ‘Dux
magnus ' above, iv. 1453 and he uses the word as equivalent to
‘imperator,’ though in the field it was different, as a ‘ dux ' had not
the ‘im rium ' or ‘auspicium.’

29. Ut deynus'venins] That you may come forth worthy of the ivy
crown and a poor lean bust, such as a half-starved poet's would be.
Busts of distinguished literary men were put up in the libi-ary of
Apollo on the Palatine, and in other ublic as well as private librarieS.

31. Tantum . . . laridare ᾰι”εει·ίοε,1 ‘ isertos ' here means poets, who
are also called ‘ docti.’ ‘ Disertus properly applies to oratory. Pea-
cocks were held sacred to Juno.

poverty, it hates itself and its own muse3 and it is too late to betake

mises with the oet by giving help that costs nothing. There was a
temple called erculis Musarum, built by Fulvius Nobilior, and re-
stored by Marcius Philippus, step-father of Augustus, after whom it
was called Porticus Philippi. The temple of Apollo to which Juvenal
refers is that on the Palatine, built by Augustus, 26th October, Β.σ.
