sA‘rmn 1. 109

96. mbae rapienda togatae] The ‘toga ³ was worn out of respect to
the great man, and it was counted bad taste for any person of respec-
tabjlity to go abroad without it. At one time it became common for
persons of family to go to the theatre without the ‘ toga,' and Augus-
tus put a stop to ‘the practice. ‘ Turba togata,’ ‘gens togata,’ were
commonly used for the Romans.

9⁷. trepidat,] This word expresses any hurried action or emotion.
‘ Inspicit et trepidat’ means he looks in the man’s face anxiously‚ with
a sharp scrutinizing eye. ‘Ille' can hardly be any but the master,
who is supposed to condescend so far as to look on and regulate the
distribution.

99. jubet a praecone vocari Ipsos Trojuqenas51 The ‘praeco' may
mean the ‘ nomenclator,' whose particular duty was to attend the
morning visits and to know all his master’s acquaintance by sight and
name, with their circumstances and all about them. The master bids
this man call up the respectable people first3 for, says Juvenal, proud
gentlemen of the old tamilies condescend to join us humble tolk in
begging. The poorer they got, the more they stuck to their pedigree.
and nothing would satisty them short of the blood of Aeneas in their
teins. For the construction, see A. 57, 8, cl ς Μ. 396, obs. 3.

101. Da Praetori, da deinde Tr1'buno.] 1t must be supposed that
sometimes magistrates (who were now sunk very low) were among
the crowds who waited on the rich. The master says to the ‘ dispen-
sator : ' ‘⁴ Give the Praetor first, after him the Tribunus ; ” but a freed·
man, who had come before either of them, asserts his claim to be
served before them; and a long speech is put into his mouth, in which
he makes himself out to be richer than the men of office, and there·
fore entitled ιο take precedence of them, an odd argument at such a
time. ‘ Sed libertinus prior est ³ is part of the narrative.

104. Natus ad Euphratem] He may mean from Cappadocia, from ⁶
which part the Romans got a good many of their slaves; or he ma
refer to the Jews, 97,000 of whom were taken captives in the Jewis
war. ‘Fenestrae ' are the holes made for carrings, and they are, called
‘ molles,’ which means effeminate. Jewish boys wore them (see
Exodus xxxii. 2). The man says he has five houses, which he lets
out for shops, and they bring in 400,000 sesterces of ipcome, which
was an equestrian fortune; or we may understand ⁴ quinque tabernae ’
to be banking houses in the forum. In that case the man means
his transactions at the ‘quinque tabernae' bring him in this income..
With ‘ quadringenta,' ‘ sestertia ' must be supplied.

106. purpura major] That is, the ‘latus clavus,' or broad purple
stripe on the tunic worn by senators, as opposed to the ‘angustus
clavus' worn by ‘equites.’ A ‘tribunus militum ’ of, the first four
legions was entitled to a seat in the senate, and therefore to the ‘latus
cll¹avus 3 ’ but it was allowed to others who were not senators under
t e em ire.

107.ρεί Laurenti cvastodae't v‘n aqro] Laurentum is near the coast, and
about eight miles from Ostia. It was a winter resort of the Romans.
and abounded with villas. Lat-ge flocks of sheep were fed there, and
