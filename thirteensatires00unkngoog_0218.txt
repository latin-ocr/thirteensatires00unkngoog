a LeNatala‘, Corvino, die] The welcoming of the day that reminds us
of our birth, and. assigmng to it a gladness which it rarely inspires
after childhood, is a conventionality as old as history. The Romans
from the earliest times observed their birthdays and those of their
rulers and great men and their friends, as religious holidays, with

3. Niveam Reyinae ducimus aquam ,·] White victims were offered to
the gods above, and black ιο those below, χθόνιοι. The worship of
Juno Regina was brought from Veii by Camillae, according to Livy,
and a temple was built ιο her under that name on the Aventine. Shc
who fought with the Gorgon (that is on her ‘ aegis ³) was Minerva,
ιο whom he has promised a like offering for the preservation of his
friend. The gods ιο whom they offered on such occasions were per·
haps chosen rather arbitrarily‚. or circumstances might direct the
choice in some instances. But Jupiter, Juno‚ and Minerva were com·
monly worshipped together. The tem le on the Capitoline hill con·
sisted of three parts, of which the mi dle was dedicated to Jupiter
Opt. Max„ that on the right ιο J uno, and the other to Minerva. The
Gorgon Medusa, whose head Perseus cut off and Pallas placed u n
her ‘ aegis,' was by some traditions an inhabitant of Africa, an so
Juvenal calls her ‘ Maura.' ‘ Pugnanti Gorgone ' is in construction
like ‘clipeo venientis et hasta' (xi. 106, where see note); it means
“fighting armei with the Gorgon '’ as the other is “coming armed
with shield and spear.'’

⁵. Sed procul extensum] A young steer is tied and chates at tho
length of the rope, and shakes his head, waiting to be offered to Jupiter
Opt. Max. It was considered a good omen, if the animal went will·
ingly ιο the altar. The Capitoline hill was also called T ian from
the treacherous Tarpeia who betrayed the citadel on that ill to the
Sabines. The precipitous part of the hill from which criminals were
thrown was more especially known by that name. ‘ Sed ’ means only
that another victim was reserved for Jove more fitting than the lamb.
‘ Coruscare ' is the same as ‘vibrare' Wine was commonly poured
on the head of the victim before it was killed, and on the parts that
were sacriflced while they were burning on the altar. They were
‘aizo sprinkled with meal or rather broken bread (mola salsa) and

8. ubera matris Demere] The meanings of the word ‘ ducere ' are very
various. It here means. as it commonly does with ‘ pocula,' to drain.
