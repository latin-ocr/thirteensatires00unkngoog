Boys wore long hair like girls (‘ incerta') till they took the ‘toga

140. Et minor ique roffi] That is, ‘ too little to be burnt.' See refer·
ence on iii. 203. It was not usual to burn children who died before
they had cut their teeth.

face dlynus Arcana,] There were no myster-ies at Rome analogous
to those of Greece, at which none but the initiated could be present,
who were bound by cath to keep secret the myster-ies (whatever they
were) then made known to them. As every Greek might be initiated
if he pleased, the secrecy did not amount to much. Nevertheless it
passed into a proverb, and the Romans took it from the Greeks.
Ceres represented the Greek Demeter, and the allusion here is to
the Eleusinian mysteries, an Attic festival which lasted seven days».
On the fifth the initiated carried torches to the temple of the goddess,
led by a priest called from his office δᾳδοῦχος. This explains ‘face
arcana,' and Juvenal says no man would be worthy ω join the torch-
bearers at the festival of Eleusis-who thought himself unconcerned in

an active meaning. There is nothing that so distinguishes man from
the beasts as his reverence for the divine Being. ‘Venerabile in-

adjectives in ‘ bilis' is common.

146. demissum traximus arcc,] ‘ Trahere ’ is often used in the various
senses of ‘ ducere! See note on xii. 8.

149. Tantum animas, nobis animum] ⁸ Anima' and ‘animus ’ are
essentially the same word, and are used as synonymous by the best
writers. But ‘anima' more commonly represents the principle of
life, and ‘animus' the rational mind. That distinction is obvious
here. This sense of ‘ indulgere: ⁴ to give,’ is not, Ι believe, fo.1nd 111
the writers before the empire.

155. Ut collata daret Μυσίῳ] “ That united confidence might bring
us sleep, secured by a neighbor’s threshold.” Juvenal says the effect
of that gift of mind was to lead men, through the affectione they
have in common, to help one another, to form communities, to quit
the woods and live in towns, to fight side by side, and to defend them-
selves behind the same walls.

166. produxisse parum est,] ‘ Produxisse ' here is like ‘extendere'
below (168) ; both express the hammering out of iron. Juvenal
says it is not enough now for men to forge the sword3 though
(‘quum ') the first smiths only knew how to make harrows and hocs
and mattocks and ahares. The ‘ sarculum ’ was a lighter instrument
than the ‘ marra,' but both were for turning the soil. The distinction
