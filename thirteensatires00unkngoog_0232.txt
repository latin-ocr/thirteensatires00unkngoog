away such fear than to put away the cause of it. Juvenal knew what
he was writing about.

taking the character of injured innocence, is amusingly illustrated in
Falstaff. As to ‘superest,' Gellius informs us that a misuse of the
word came into fashion, as in the expression ‘ hic illi superest,' ⁴ this is
that mau's advocate.' On some occasion the praetor, in reply to an
advocate who said ‘ ego illi supersum,’ wittily retorted, ‘ tu plane

51qu (adessleh ‘tFiducia' is confidence (in a good sense), confidence
in s own ones .

110. Alienum (ιέἰί Μὴ] ‘ All the while he is only acting like the run·
away slave in some mimus of Catullus,' who is referred to on viii.
186, w1th his plays Phasma and Laureolus. The name of the slave in
the play (here called ‘ scurra '), the Scholiast says. was Voranus. He
was a great thies, and stole some money from a banker, on which
there is a joke of which the point does not appear. ⁴ Urbani ' is ‘ witty.’

112. ut Stentora vincere possis] Stentor was the Greek herald with
the mighty voice in Homer; his voice was as loud as the shout of
fifty men. But Ares, when Diomed wounded him, according to the
poet, shouted as loud as nine thousand or ten thousand men in battle.

113. Audis, duppiter, Ilaec] ‘Labra movere’ is opposed to ‘mittere
Jsscem ; ’ the one is a suppressed cry hardly audible, the other loud.

ec ’ is ‘ not even.

115. Debueras] ‘ It had been thy duty to speak out hadst thou been
marble or bronze! The use of this form for ⁴ debuisses ⁹ has been
noticed above on iii.163. As to Vagellius, the name occurs below,
xvi. 23. The person is unknown. The writer must have had some
statue in his mind. The Scholiast says Vagellius was a great fool,
but like the gods he got a statue. ‘ Omentum' is pro rly the mem·
branc that covers the boweIS, and the word is so use still. Here it
means the entrails.

120. Accipe quae contra] He begs him to accept such consolation as
even he, who professes to be no philosopher, never to have read the
dogmas of Cynics or Stoics, and to be no admirer of Epicurus, may
be able to offer him. The name of the Cynics was given them in the
time of their founder, Antisthenes, immediately after the death of
Socrates, his teacher. But the popular idea of their character is de-
rived more from Diogenes of Sinope, the crabbed disciple of Antis·
thenes. The Stoic school was founded full three-quartem of a century
after the Cynic by Zen0, who had in his earlier studies attached him·
sels to the Cynics, but modified his opinione„ and gave to the views of
that school a more general and expansive character. But the Stoics,
too, became more contracted under the successors of their founder,
and in the popular notions of Juvenal's time. as in our own, there was
not much difference between the two systema. Juvenal professes to
