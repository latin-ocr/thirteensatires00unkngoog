Prof. A. Ρ. Montague, Cdumbian Um'vem‘ty, Washinqton, D. 0. —1 am
using all the books of the Bennett Series in my various classes, and am
charmed with them. So far as my experience goes, they are by far tlue
best books of the kind now before the public, and Ι heartily commend

ffiem. ,

Dr. A. C. PerkinS, Phillzps-Exeter Academy.—We take Bennett’s “ First
Latin Writer'' as the best Manual of Latin composition for the first two
years of our course. The “Easy Latin Stories‚” by the same author, is
excellently fitted for pupils when they are beginning to read Latin.

Dr. H. T. Fuller, Se. Johnsbury Academy, Vt.—We have used Bennett’s
“First Latin Writer’' for the last two years, and find it eminently satis-
factory. It involves a knowledge of all the principles of grammar and
Latin idioms, and, by a skilful selection of review work, obliges the pupil to
keep what he has once acquired. Its breadth of vocabulary is commendabis
in that it is not restricted to the words of any single author.

Prof. C. masmim, Harvard αἰώρα-Ῥω “Second Latin Writer'’ is
quite a useful book, and contains a very valuable collection of exercises·
The Introduction gives the student sound advice, and many excellent notes

on idiom.

JAMRS S. Rau), M.A.‚ Cambridge, England. American edition,
revised by Professor ancrs W. Knrsnr, Lake Forest Univer-
sity. Second Edition. 16mo, 279 peges, 8120. Each part
separately‚ 80:70.

Prof. M. Μ. Fisher‚ University qf Missomi. - The edition is in every
respect the best 1 have seen, and Ι shall use it in my classes.

Prof. J. H. chamberlin, Marietta Colleye, ΟΙιίο. - It is certainly the best
edition of these works of Cicero with which I am acquainted. Ι have used
the edition by Reid, and consider it a work of high merit. Professor
Kelsey’s revision seems to me to retain all the desirable features of the

original edition, while much has been added which is of especial value to
the American student.

Prof. Α. G. Hopkins, Hammon Colleqe, New York.-It is a handsome
piece of work in every respect, and will, 1 doubt not, meet with a cordial re-
ception. The text is far better than that of any other edition, and the notes
are very clear and scholarly. 1 know of nothing better for our use here.

cicero Pro Cluentio, With Notes by Professor Ans'rm
STICKNEY. Fourth Edition. mmo, 156 pageS, fflLSO. .

This edition is intended for use as a college text-book, and the notes are
designed to supply the student only with such information in respect to the
facts of the case and the scope of the argument, as is necessary to the proper
understanding of the Oration.
