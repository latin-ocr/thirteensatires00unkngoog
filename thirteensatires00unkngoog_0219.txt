bovem.'’ It is the ordinary word for marrying a wife (i. 22), for
moulding a statue (vii. 237), for burying the dead (i. 1463 x. 240),
for drawing lots (vi. 533), for dragging by the heels (v. 1253 x 66),
for spinning (xii. 65), for contracting (as we say of a stain, etc.) (xiii.
216); duvenal also uses it for stealing (xiii. 152). In many of its
significatione ‘ trahere ’ is used synonymously with it (verse 11).
‘ Quippe ferox vitulus,' ‘ sure 'tis a wild steer.' '

u. Pinyuior Hispulla] He says it his means were equal to his affec-

ing definite is known. The beast should be hardly able to carry its
own weight (a prize ox), not reared in the pastures about Rome, but
a white beast whose breeding (sanguis) should show that he came
from the Clitumnus. This was a. small stream in Umbria, which flowed
through a valley rich in pastum-land, and celebrated for a breed of
peculiarly white sheep and cattle. The stream was held in religious
veneration, and there were many small temples near the source. For

person who bore the title of ‘ popa! It was the practice first to strike
the victim on the head with a hammer to stun it, and then to cut the
throat‚ or chop the neck with an axe. The victim was ‘mactata'
after the blow of the hammer, which was administered by the ‘ popa 3 ’
the ‘ cultrarius ⁹ probably was a lower officer who finished the busi-
ness. Juvenal speaks of him as a burly fellow, ‘ grandi.' The gerun-
dive is rarely construed‚ as in verse 14, with ‘a’ and the ablativo.

of shipwrecked sailors hanging u pictures in the temples (of Isis in
particular) is often alluded to. hey also carried such pictures about
to get pity and alms. The painters, then, might well be said to get
their living by Isis. The misfortune is described to be the throwing

picturas ot this sort, for the first expedient in danger was to lighten
