Romans first used elephants iu the war against Philip of Macedon,
no. mo. This was the year after the conclusion of the second Punic
war, in which Livy says these elephants were taken. Pliny says
that elephante were first exhibited iu the Circus in the year nc. 99.
The last syllable in ‘belli’ (verse 110 is preserved from elision.

111„ Nulla ἐρίων ηιονα per Not-iuna] his means that Novius and
Pacuvius (who may be anybody) are uite ready, and the difficulty is
not on their part if it is not done, to o er ele hants on the altar of Gal-
lita’s Lares. On the use of ‘quin‚’ see A. 6 ‚ 1, b; M. 375‚c; Ζ. 643.

11⁵. Alter εηίηι, εἰ concedas] ⁶ Enim ' means they would not hesitate
about an elephant, for one of them would be quite ready to offer
human sacrifices for the life of the rich woman, or even his own child,
as Agamemnon did, though he could not expect her to be delivered
and a hind substituted in her place, as the story is about Iphi enia.
‘ Tragicae ' means that this is the story in the Tragedians. The o nce

had also shot a hind loved b Diana. For the 'subj unctive in ⁴ conce·

121. [mado roceam civennj So the master commended the unjust
steward because he was wise in his generation. He says ironically
that the safety of a thousand ships (referring, perhaps, to Agamem-
non’s fleet, for the safety of which he sacnfloed his daughter) is noth·

out again. ‘ Libitina ’ was the goddess of funerals and all things per-

taining to the dead. She is identified by some authors with Proserpina,
mil-212⁷ others with Venus.

Post meritum sane mirandum] After a service truly astonishing,
that is the effectual vows of Pacuvius, to which he is ready to attrib
ute his recovery. For this service, he will perhaps. make him his
sole ‘ heres ' (heres ex asse). ‘ Breviter,’ ‘ in few words? ‘ Rivalibus '
is here used in an uncommon way. Its derived sense elsewhere has
reference only to rivalry in love.

126. Erqo vides quam Grande] “ So you see what a return for his
sufferings the death of one Mycenaean damsel won.'' He supposes
him to have had a ‘ nubilis Iphigenia,' and to have sacrificed her, and
to have had his trouble soothed by the fruits of his devotion in the
old man’s will. Iphigenia is represented in the story as having been
sent for to Aulis by her father under the pretence that she was to be
married to Achilles. ‘ Mycenis ' is an adjective.

128. vel Nestora totum ‚·] See x. 246. “ Let him live a whole
Nestor.” The accusative is that of kindred signification. Nero’s
motto was: “ Hoc agamus ne quis quidquam habeat,'' “let it be our
eudeavor that no one shall have any thing.'' He robbcd provinces, and
he robbed rich citizens. No one could call his money his own.
