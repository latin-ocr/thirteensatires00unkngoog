municipium, and there Cicero was born, ac. 106. He was the flrst of
his gens (Tullia) that had curule honors, and was therefore ‘novus
homo' and ‘ignobilis.’ After him his family became ‘nobilis.’ He
was consul ac. 63, and in that year the conspiracy of Catilina was
formed. Cicero often alludes to his own connection with the eques·
trian order. . ‘ Galeatum’ means with their helmets on ready for

‘Nominis et tituli' is a common way of speaking, where a general
term is put first and a particular form of it follows, The title was
⁸ pater patriae! Cicero was honored by Catulus and Cato addressing
him as ⁸ parens patriae.' ⁴ And at that time,' Juvenal adds, ‘ they

and to other emperors after him, they were not free. By Leucas he
'means the battle of Actium, which place was about thirty miles north

Philip i, which was in Thrace, but was included in the province of
Mac onia. ‘ Thessaliae campis’ therefore is an inaccuracy, proba·
bly aris‘mg from a confusion of Philippi with Pharsalia which Juvenal
shares with other authors. See Merivale, iii. 170, note 2. The original
name of Augustus was C. Octavius3 but he dropped this at his great
uncle's death, and then he became C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, to
which the title of Augustus was added, 13.c. 27.

24ἕ Arpinus alius] This was C. Marius, who was also born at
Arpinum of poor parents. He served in the cavalry at the siege of
Numantia under Scipio Africanus Minor. His military abilities raised
him to high estate, and he married a great lady, Julia, the aunt of
him who was afterwards the Dictator, C. Caesar. The vine switch was
commonly used for military floggings3 and he says Marius had the
