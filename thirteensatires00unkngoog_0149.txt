SATIRE ³ IV.

Tun point on which this Satire turns is the degradation of the sena-
tors, some of whom the poet mentions by name. The sketches of
character are very good, and are evidently drawn from life. The poem
must have been published after the death οἱ Domitian which took
place in the year 96, and after the publication of the first Satire which
was as late as Am. 100. See Merivale, vn. 139, sqq.

the murder of her nobles, whom yet he might have destroyed with

is taken from the stage. ‘ Redemptum ’ is ‘ redeemed from infamy‚'
as it were from slavery. The more usual expression is ‘ redimere
vitia virtutibus.' ‘ Aeger ’ means that he was feeble, ‘ fortis,’ resolute.

of the Forum was covered with houses and public buildings, but
between Mons Capitolinus and the Campus Martius there was space
for large gardens such as Agrippa had there. They must have
been very costly in such a neighborhood‚ which is what Juvenal
means. There were private as well as ublic covered walks and drives
(Wfficm) about the city. ‘ Fatiget pis a poetical word in this con·
