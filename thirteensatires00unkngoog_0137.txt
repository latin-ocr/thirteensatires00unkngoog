SATIRE 111. 121

ss this should not be classed with the subjunctive of concessiong they
ne the nbjmneeve of su ‘tion.

82 fuqeam conchylia-qm fine clothes dyed with purple, the juice
of the shell·fish purpura and murex. Persona of most consideration
would naturally. sign wills and so forth as wimesses before their iu·
feriore, and lie upon handsome sosas with fine coverings.

83. quo pruna et cottona vento 7] Pliny says ‘ cottona ⁹ was the name
of small figs from Syria. He also speaks in the same place of plums
from Damascus (“Damsons''), of which both 'were well known to
the Italians. 'ro these imported fruits the ‘ bacca Sabina' is opposed
—the olive grown on the Sabine hilis, where it still grows in abun-
(lance. The Aventine is put for Rome as the Esquiliae and Viminal
were above.

88. collum cervicibus aequat] ‘ Collum ' signifies the whole neck be-
fore and behind, including the throat3 ‘ cervix ’ the hinder part,
where the strength of the neck lies. Antaeus, the giant wrestler of
Libya, was beaten ¹by Hercules only by lifting him up stom his mother
earth, from whom he got all his strength, and so squeezing him to
death. There were many pietures and sculptures representing the
scene ; and Juvenal writes as if he had seen one.

91. quo mordetur qallina marito. ‘ Marito' is the ablativo of the

agent, without the pre osition. . 388, 4 ; Β. 879; Α. ἃ, S. 248, R. 3.
The noun is expresse in the relative clause, and must be supplied
with ‘ille’ in the antecedent clause. M. 319, obs.; A. 48, 3, ὸς Β.
687; A. 8⁶ S. 206, (3), (b).
, 92. sed illis Creditum] ‘ We may flatter just as they do, but they
are believed (and we are not).' An instance of this is mentioned iu
the life of Nero. He had a great opinion of his musical talents, and
paid a visit to Greece in order to display them there. He sang at a
dinner party, and being highly applauded, he is said to have cried,
“ Solos scire audire Graecos, solosque se et studiis suis dignos.’'

93. An melior quum Thaida sustinet] ‘ Is there a better actor than he
when he plays a courtezan, or a chaste matmn, or an unveiled strum-
pet? You could declare it was a woman before you, not a masked
man? The mask is put for the man who wore it. ‘ Palliolum ' was a
small square eloth worn over the head to protect it from the weather,
or, in the case of rostitutes, to hide the face. Men wore it only
when they were sicfi.

100. Rides‚] See A. 60, 1, c; A. 8⁵ S. 261, R. 1; Μ. 442, a, obs. 2.

103. Accipit endromidem ,·] This was a thick Gaulish blanket, worn
in cold westher, or when a man had heated himself by rumiing, from
which the name is derived. Compare Hamlet’s dialogue with Osric:
“ Ο. 1 thauk your lordship, 'tis very hot.

H. No, believe me, 'tis very cold ; the wind is northerly.

Ο. It is indifferent cold‚ my lox-d, indeed.

H. But yet methinks itis very sultry and hot for my complexion.

0.¹Exce9ding1y‚ my lord, it is very sultry as it were, 1 can't tell

iow.'
