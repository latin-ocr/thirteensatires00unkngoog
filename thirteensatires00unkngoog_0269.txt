Abbott's Latin Prose through English Idiom. Rules and
Exercises on Latin Prose composition. By the Rev. Enwm A.
ΑΒΒΟΤΤ, D.D., Head-Master of the City of London School.

The author’s object is to prepare studente for the study and composition
of Latin Prose, by calling their attention first to the peculiarities of English
idiom‚ and then to the methods of representing the English in the corre-
sponding Latin idiom. A good deal of space has been given to the Prepo-

sitions. The Exercises are purposely unarranged‚ as connected examples
are useless to test a pupil's knowledge.

Prof. Gen. 0. Holbrooke, Trinity Colleqe, Hartsord. — Abbott’s Lat-in
Prose is the best book of the kind with which I am acquainted. It teaches
the student to compose Latin, instead of translating stock sentences.

Prof. E. H. Griffin‚ Williams Colleye‚ Williamstown. -Any book by the
author of ‘⁴ English Lessons’' and the “ Shaksperian Grammar'’ 1 should
expect to be good. This seems to me simply admirable, and ia quite aa
valuable for the study of English as for the study of Latin

Prof. C. L. Smith, Harvard Colleqe. — I feel sure the book‘ will be
widely used, as it deals with Latin Composition in the only right way.
