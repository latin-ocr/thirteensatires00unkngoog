sATIRn XVI. · 249

7. communia,] rhat which all soldiers held in common. ‘ Togatus '
is the common word for a civilian. ⁴ Immo’ here is affirmative 01
what precedes, and introduces something more. It is sometimes used
negatively according to the nature 01 the sentence3 but its common
use is to add some statement, reason, etc„ in continuation and sup ort
01 what goes before. ‘ Ne’ (from which ‘ ut' must be supplied be ore
‘ dissimulet‚’ M. 462, b) seems used to introduce an appositional clause.
If so, it must be used for ‘ ut non! Compare M. 3743 A. 70, 4,f; Z.
623. It may be explained in another way, as depending on an idea 01
hindering to be supplied.

11. tumidis livorzbus offam] ‘ Offa,' which is used for a chop or other
piece 01 meat, here means a swelling from a blow. ‘Livoribus ’ are
black contusions. ‘ Medico nil promittente ’ means that the doctor
cannot warrant that the man will not lose his eye.

13. Bardaicus judex datur] ‘Judex ' is predicate. It is not certain
that ‘bardaicus ’ agrees, as many take it, with ‘ calceus ' in this place.
1 think it may be taken independently. ‘ Calceus ’ will in that case be
qualified like ⁴ surae ’ by ‘ grandes.’ ‘ Calceus ’ was the general name
for a walking shoe or boot as opposed to others worn in the house, or
sandals which only covered the sole or were strapped on to the upper
part 01 the foot. 01 the latter sort were ‘caligae’ (verse 24) which
were heavy sandals with nails worn by the common soldiers as the
‘ calceus ’ was worn by the Officers, though sometimes the officers wore
‘caligae' See 111. 321, 11. The name ‘bardaicus ' is said to be derived
from the Bardaei, an Illyrian people from whom this sort of military
sboe was taken. Juvenal says (according to the above) 11 a man
wishes to punish the soldier ‚who has maltreated him, the judex as·

if he 18 allowed a trial it will be a court-martial with a centurion 101·
judex. ‘ Judicem dare ' was properly said 01 the praetor, who could
appoint if he pleased a judex privatus to hear a private case at the in-
stance 01 the plaintiff. It is usual to describe the centurions as stout
men. Juvenal speaks here of great benches to match the great legs.
All is in the rough way.

15. more Camilli] The days 01 the old discipline when M. Furius
Camillus was dictator and besieged Veii (13.c. 393).

1⁷. Justissima Centurionum] Juvenal says that the centurions give
just judgment against a soldier, and 11 a man goes ‘before them with
a good complaint he will get satisfaction. But he w1ll find the whole
camp set against him, and his satisfaction will be worse 101· 111111 than
his wrong. ‘ Igitur ’ serves to keep the sentences together: ‘ Well
then the centurion will give just judgment! When he says ⁴ nec 1111111
- deerit,’ he puts himself in the position of an injured civilian‚ as below,

verse 28, “ non sollicitemus amicos.'’ ‘ Deerit must be read m two
syllables. ‘ Querelae ’ is the genitive 01 quality, ‘ a cause in which the
complaint is just! ‘ Deferre‚' with or without ‘ nomen‚’ means to in-
form against. ‘ Deferre causam ’ is not a legal hrase. ‘ Tota cohors ⁹
is put generally for ‘ tota castra ’ (verse 2). ‘ gonsensu magno ' is an
ordinary phrase 101· perfect unanimity.
