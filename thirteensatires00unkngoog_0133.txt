of men of low birth, who got their living by cheating, and made them·
selves rich by such means. But this is only gathered from the con-
text.

30. qui nimum in candida vertunt,] ‘ Wbo will swear black is white,'
which was a proverbial way of speaking with the Romans as with us.

Governtnent contracts have in all times been profitable affairs. J uve-
nal speaks of men contracting for the repair of teinples and shrines‚
as well as for clearing the beds of rivers, cleansing and keeping the
sewers, the repairing of harbors, and likewise for fauentis, and for the
sale os slaves by auction. Public works, which under the republic
were looked after by the aediles, had special officere (curatores) to

(redemptores) to carry out the necessary works. The clearing of the
Tiber was particularly necessary from the quantity of alluvial soil
brought down by the stream and the rapidity with which weeds
formed in the bed. The Cloaca Maxima, said to have been constructed
by Tarquinius Priscus, was large enough for a boat or a waggon of
hay to pass down it. The underground works of Rome were on
nearly as large a scale in proportion as those of London. The eost of
keeping these drains in repair was very large ; though the solid con-
struction of the Cloaca Maxima with stone arches, of which remains
still. exist, left little to be done for that. On occasions when a pub·
lic funeral (‘ funus indictivum' or ‘ censorium ’) was decreed‚ such as
Tacitus osten mentions, it was performed through a ‘ redemptor,’
whose duty it would be to provide mourners (men and women), mu-
sicians, ‘ lectica' and bearet-s, funeral pile, and every thing connected
with the procession, burning, and burial of the body, on such a scale
as the senate might determine. ‘Busta ' were places adjoining sep-
ulchres, where the bodies were burnt.

A sale by auction on the public account was conducted by a
‘ praeco ' in the presence of a public officer, and a spear was set up
on the spot where the auction took place. It may have been called
‘domina' in this place because the sale transferred to the purchaser
‘ dominium‚’ or ownership, in the thing purchased. The spear is said
to have been derived from the practice followed in old times in the
selling of prisoners and booty on the field of battle. ‘ Praebere ’ is
here ‘ to put up to auction.' The word ‘ venalia ’ belonged especially
to s aves.

were well known. ‘⁴ Now they give shows of gladiators themselves,
and put men to death to please the people,’' who, when a gladiator
had his adversary down. gave the signal for his despatch or to spare
him, by turning their thumbs up or down. The number of victims
at these shows was enormem, and they were never more frequent
than in the reign of Domitian. The expense lavished on them was
likewise beyond belief.
