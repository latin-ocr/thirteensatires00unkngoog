SATIRE 1v. 135

24,000‚000—0n eating‚ drinking... and his lustu, he hanged himself,
chagrined at having only 8400,οω left.

24 papyro] This corresponds with what he called him before,
“ pars Niliacae plebis—verna Canopi '' (i. 26). Of the coarser kind oi
pstpylrus (calleda‘demporetica'), which was not used for writing, various

c es were m e.

Potuit sortasse minoris] The price of slaves varied of course very
much. An inferior sort of slave, for such purpooes as this, might
commonly be bought for less than the fish. He adds, that in ‚thc
provinces men can get a large estate for such a sum, and a larger in
Apulia, which seems to imply that land in Apulia was cheaper than
in the provinces; but then it must have been bad land, for some oi
the corn-land there would be valuable. The quantity of the first syl-
lable in ‘Apulia’ is common.

28. putamus] See iii. 296, n. ‘ Glutisse’ is an onomatopoetic word;
‘ glutton' is derived from it.

29. Induperatorem,l The preposition ‘ in ’ in ‘impero’ (the first
meaning of which is ‘to put upon,’ ‘to impose‚’ the thing imposed
being expressed or understood) ιε represented in the earlier poets by
the forms ‘endo ⁹ and ‘ indu,' corresponding to the Greek ἔνδον. Other
words that are found in Lucretius and others with the same form of
the preposition are ‘endopedire,' ‘ endogredi,' ‘endoplorare,' ‘endo-
tueri! ‘ Imperator ' cannot be used in hexameter.

30. de maryine coenae,] The principal dish, ‘caput coenae,’ which at
large dinners was commonly a boar, was ut in the middle of the
table3 ‘ de margine ' corresponds to a ‘side- ish)

31. scurra Palma] The palace which the successive emperors oc-
cupied was on the Palatine Hill. The ruins still remain. lt was
built by Augustus, and much enlarged by his successore. Domitian
spent a great deal of money in decorating and enlarging it, but most
of the ornaments with which he adorned it were removed by Trajan
to the Temple of Jupiter Ca itolinus.

32. Jam princeps Equitum, This is a way of speaking3 there was no
officer who bore that title.

33. fracta de merce siluros] Pliny mentions the ‘silurus ’ as a fish of
the Nile. ‘Municipes ⁹ means that they were countrymen of Cris·
pinus. ‘Fracta de merce ' may mean that the fish were part os a
damaged lot. Heinrich says the true reading is ‘ farta,’ and that he is
referring to flsh packed in casks. It may be so. The Scholiast says
it means that the cask was broken that contained the fish. It might
mean that the cask was broken open to sell the flsh.

34. Incipe, Calliope,] He invokes the E ic Muse ; but he says this is not
matter for a song, that is, for fiction an ornament, but a grave matter
of fact on which they should sit and deliberate. Juvenal claims credit
for calling them ‘ puellae,’ which word was only used for chaste young
women, single or married.

37. Quum jam semianimum] The full name of Domitian was T.
