ΗΒΕ or JUVENAL. vii

Hadrian Aa). 138, when Juvenal was, according to this
sketch, eighty or a little more.

Thus thc statements of the Grammarians in respect to
the poet’s age, and of that writer who says he died of old
age m the time ol Antoninus Piae, would be borne out.
1 have also allowed thc fact of an honorable banishment
into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the Gram-
maeians (the supposed attack on the pantomimo Paris),
which is impossible. That Juvenal did not professedly
compose satire till late in life, is admitted and accounted
for. Likewise that he may have written verses before he
ventured to publish them, and that some of these were
afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is allowed. It is
also admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these
facts the Grammarians, 1 believe, have been misled.

Independently of the chronological difficulties in respect
to Paris, it does not appear that the verses quoted by the
Grammarians (vii. 90-92) were ever intended as a satire on
him, but if any thing as a eompliment. So at least they
appear in the connection in which we have them. And it
is perfectly clear that in that· connection they could not
have given offence to the emperor, whoever he was, since
the Satire sets out from the first with such praise as the
worst of these princes eoveted and rewarded, praise for
his exclusive support of learning. If therefore it had been
possible to admit these verses as the cause of Domitiau’s
displeasure, it must have been when they appeared sepa-
rately as an epigram, or with a different context from the
present, which it must be admitted they do not very well
suit, 113 as seems certain, the rest of the Satire was written
long aster Paris’s death.
