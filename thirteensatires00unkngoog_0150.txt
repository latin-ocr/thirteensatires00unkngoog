woman was buried and left to starve in a cell in the Campus Sceleratus
in the Sixth Region of the city. The man was put to death by scourg-
ing. The future participle expresses merely the risk which the woman
ran; it does not necessarily imply that she was punished. Domitian
revived the law about vestale„ but Juvenal says his favorite, Cris-
pinus, could break it with impunity, and had lately done so, though
the woman might undergo the usual punishment. ⁸ Nuper,' however,
does not limit the act to a very short time before, though it was
probably not long. One of the first acts after a vestal was convicted
was to strip her of her vitta, which all the virgins wore when on
duty. ‘Cum quo’ is for the more common ‘quocum' or ‘quicum.’

12 caderet sub judice morum] This the Scholiast explains rightly,
‘ damnaretur a censore.' The ‘judex morum ' was the censor, and
here means Domitian, who took that office for his life. The proceed-
ing that Juvenal is going to relate should have brought the man under
the censor, as the corrector of extravagance, a part of his duty being
to enforce such sumptuary laws as were in existence from time to
time. After Augustus they feu into ‚disuse ‘ Feci ’ was‚the technical

13. Titio See'oqnel These names were commonly used in legal pro-

ceedings, and mean no rsons in particular here. In English we say
‘ John Doe and Richa Boe! ‘ Diva et foedior ' = divior et foedior.
' 15. persona] In the law writers ‘ personae ’ signifies persons, that is,
human beings as invested with a certain character by which they
become objects of law, as opposed to things which are not persons,
but either material things, as obiects of property, or legal facts, as
contracte and the like. '

Mullum sex millibus emim] A mullet or barbel of six pounds was
unusually large. The price paid for this 'was equivalent to about
3234. Juvenal admits this was probably a fabulous price ; but Pliny
tells of one that cost 8000 sesterces. ‘ Sane‚' ‘ to be sure‚' introduces
an ironical excuse.

19. Praeci uam in tabulis ceram] This is equivalent to being declared
the old man s heres. A will was usually contained in three tablets
(prima, secunda, and ima cera or tabula), in the two first of which
were entered the names of the heredes, and in the third those of the
‘ substituti‚' who took in the event of any heres being disqualified, etc.
As to ‘ orbi,' see above, iii. 129, n.

20. Est ratio ulterior] There is another way of accounting for it, or
another excuse, supposing he sent it to some great lady who was fond
of him, and who went, about in her ‘sella’ with closed doors, but
large windows that she could look out of and be seen through.

2‘3. Quae miser ee finqi non—fecit Apicium] M. Fabius Apicius, whose
name has been proverbial for good living from the time of Tiberius,
when he lived, is here called ⁴ miser et frugi ’ by way of comparison
with Crispinus. After spending an enormous fortune —towards
