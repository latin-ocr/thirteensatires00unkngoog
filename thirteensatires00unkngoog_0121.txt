' 4⁷. et hic danmatus inani Judae'cio] We have the private thies and the
public brought together. Marius Priscus, proconsul of Africa, was
eonvicted (Aa). 100) of ‘ repetundaessand banished from Italy. Marius

‘ repetundae,’ which was that of a magistrate getting money by illegal
means from the provinciale under his governinent, was punished with
different penalties at different times. The latest ‘ lex ’ on the subject
was the ‘lex Julia‚’ passed in the dictatorship os (ἶ. ‚Julius Caesar,
which abolished the punishment of exile ; but it appears to have been
revived under the empire. The refunding of the mone proved to
have been received was always part of the penalty3 a in this in·
stanee it appears that 700 sestertia (about 827,600) were paid by
Marius into the treasury. ‘ Ab octava bibit’ means that he sat down
to dinner earlier than usual; the ninth hour in summer, and the tensh
in winter, being those at which industrious persons generally dined.
‘ Fruitur dis iratis,’ he enjoys the anger of the gods ; that is, he makes
himself comfortable under his punishment. For the idiom, sec A. 72,
8, ας Η. 58ος Β. 1357; A. & S. 274, R. 5. ‘Vincere’ is the legal
word for succeeding in a cause. ,

51. Venusina clayna lucerna ?] Horace was born at Venusia, on the
Appian Way, between Beneventum and Tarentum, n.c. 65. He
seems to have been looked upon by Persius and Juvenal as the repre·
sentative of Roman satire. Lucilius was more in Juvenal's way, and
he mentions him below with respect. ‘Lucerna’ only means w’hat
we mean when we speak of the ⁶ midnight oil.’

⁵2. Sed quid maye's Heracleas] ‘ Agiiem ’ must be repeated, but in a
different sense. ‘ Fabulas ' is the noun to be supplied, if any is
needed. He asks why he should rather write on such hackneyed
subjects as the labors of Hercules, the wanderings of Diomed, the ad·
ventures of Theseus, Icarus, and Daedalus, than attack the vices of
the day ’.ἱ ‘ Puero' may be the ablative of ‘⁴ dead weight,'’ as Mayor
calls it, or the dative. See references on verse 13. ‘ Mugitum ’ refers
of course to the Minotaur.

⁵⁵. Quum leno accipiat moechi bona] This man connives at his wife’s
intrigues at his own table, and gets her paramour to make him his
⁸ heres,' which the woman could not be, if the man’s census exceeded
100,000 asses. He fixes his eyes on the ceiling, as if wrapped in
thought, or pretends to snore over his wine.

58. Quum fas esse putet] “ When that man thinks he has a right to
look for a tribune's place, who, while yet a boy, wasted his substance
on his stables, and lost his patrimony with flying on swift coach down
the Flaminian road; for he was Automedon and held the reins while
the great man made himself pleasant to his man-mistress.” This per·
son may have been some favorite of Domitian’s, who had been made,
or hoped to be made, a ‘ tribunus militum) The Flaminian road led
north from Rome to Ariminum. ‘ Ipse ' is often used independently
for ‘ the great man,’ and is here opposed to Automedon, as Achilles to
