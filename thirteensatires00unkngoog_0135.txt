suma 111. 119

how small a portion of our dregs are from Greece‘i ' ‘ Quota' with
‘ pars ' (or here ‘ portio ’) generally signifies ‘how small a part! ‘ Quo-
tus ' is the question which is answered by an‘ordinal numeral (M. 7 4,
obs. 23 A. ἃ, S. 119, ιι), and ‘ quota pars' means properly, in a series
ot· graduatcd parts what place would the thing occupy'l and the im-
plication is that it would come very late in the series. ‘ Whath part '
(if we had shch a word) would express ‘quota pars,’ as ⁴ septima pars,'
⁸ octava,'- etc„ would be the seventh‚ eighth‚ etc.. part.

62. in Tiberim defluxit Orontes] The Orontes is here put generally
for the province of Syria, which was added to the Roman dominioug
by Cn. Pompeius, 13.c. 65. Its own trade, and that of the East, to

music; and on lower ground than Umbricius takes, he might have
run away from the music of Baetem fiageolets, harps, and drums.
They were probably such as are still in use all over Asia, and no dis—
cord is comparable to that which is there listened to with satisfaction.
The first instrument has usually but two or three holes, and no stops,
and the last (corresponding to the Indian tomtom) is beaten with no
perceptible reference to time. The sort of harp here mentioned was
mlled ‘ sambuca,' and it was triangular, which is meant by ‘ obliquas!
The Circus Maximus had vaults under it, which were occupied by
prostitutes. ‘J ussas ’ means that they were hired for the purpose by
others, who made gain of their prostitution. For the construction,
see i. 99, note. ⁴ Ite ’ means ‘ go thither.’

66. picta lu barbara miti-al] ‘Pictus‚' like ποικίλος, means ‘em-
broidered.' 'leh'e women in Eastern Asia do not wear any thing on
their head but a veil to draw over their face. The ‘ mitra,’ a sort of
light turban, belonged to the women of Syria and Asia Minor. The
effeminate Romans took to wearing it. It is always associated with
them or with harlots. Why these persons should be called by a name
which means a she-wolf is obvious. According to Livy, the story of
Romulus and Remus being nursed Py? wolf is founded on their hav-

the Scholiast says they were Greek shoes (caligulae) worn by para-
sites running to dinner. The derivation from τρέχειν and δεῖπνον is
obvious enough3 and whatever the things were, the context shows
they were Greek. That they were shoes may be infer-red from the
name. ⁶ Rusticus? does not here mean a rustic literally, but the de-

scendants of rustica.

' 68. Et ceromatico sert niceteria colla] ‘ Ceroma’ (κὴρωμα) was a prep-
aration of clay, oil‚ and wax, with which the Greek wrestlers were
anointed. ‘ Niceteria’ (νικητῆρια here means the prizes of victory for
wrestling‚ a practice introduce at Rome under the empire. The
early Romans despised the Greek gymnastic exercises, and Nero was
the first to build a public gymnasium or training school for wrestlers,
etc. Juvenal mentions this as one of the discreditable Greek innova-
tions. He uses Greek words designedly.
