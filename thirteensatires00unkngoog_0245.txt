“ 107. Sponte tamen juvenes] But though young men are only too
prone to imitate, yet there is one vice of which this cannot be said;
to avarice they are not only not prone, but even averse (⁴ inviti quo-
que '). This is true generally, but not universally. ‘ Quoque ’ is
equivalent to ‘etiam' or ‘vel;’ the usage has been noticed above.
‘ Fallit enim' is elliptical; they are bid and the‘y' do as they are bid,
for they are deceived by the appearance of virtue, though it is but the
shadow, which this vice wears. ‘ Habitu ’ is the general appearance,
and applies equally to ‘ vultu ' and ‘ veste! ‘ Frugi ’ is always used in
a good sense for ‘ prudent ’ or ‘ thrifty) ‘ Tutela ' is used for ⁸ tutor '
by a common fi re of speech—“ metonomy.’'

114. Hesperi vem serpens aut ΡοηὶέίεαεἽ1 The Hesperides watched the
apples and the serpent Ladon watched t e Hesperides Hercules killed
him. The golden fieece of Colchis in Pontus was also guarded by a
serpent, but Medea put him to sleep and Jason took the fleece. The
miser watching his treasures is said to watch better than this. As to
the Hesperides», see above. v. 152, n.

laune de Quo loquor] Juvenal supposes a respectable-looking person
of this sort, such as the father might point out to his son as an instance
of the beneflts of thriftinesS.

115. putat acquirendi] Public opinion treats the-man as a workman
diligent in his calling, which is to make money, and this he gets any
way}r he can, plying the anvil and working the forge from morning till
ni ιι.

ἱ19. Et pater erqo] “ The father too, as 1 sai‹1;” another instance
of · ergo' in this sense (see x. 54, n.). The young are taken in by the
reputation the miser gets, and they are also influenced by their fathers'
example and precept.

120. Qui miratur opes] He is not speakIng of all fathers, for some
ate extravagant, but ot' the money-loving father. And so he says the
father thinks the covetous happy, that is, he who admires wealth and
thinks there never was an instance of a man who was at once poor
and savored by heaven ; such a man advises his sons to go that road and
adhere to that sect (as if they were the only philosophers). ‘ Felices '
are happy rnen ς ‘beati ' are those who prosper or are favored by the
gods. ‘ Pauper ’ is not used for an indigent person, but for one of small
means, and such may prosper3 but this father thinks not, because the
more a man has the more he gets.

123. Sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa 3] He says all vices have their
elements as every science has, and in teaching their children this vice
of covetousness fathers begin with petty acts of meannesS, and after-
wards teach it them on the largest scale.

126. Servorum. ventree] He here gives a description of avarice, such
as these fathers would furnish examples of, and the form of the satire
changes. He is speaking of the domestic arrangements of the miser,
in which he punishes himself not less than his wretched slaves. He
{erves fout their allowance of corn in a false measure, while he starves

127. neque enim omnia sustinet] ‘ Neque' is ‘not even-⁹ ‘ Sustinere'
