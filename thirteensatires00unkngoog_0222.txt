heights of Alba. Where the Trojans lauded in Latium Aeneas built
a town and called it Lavinium after his wife Lavinia. Thirty years
afterwards, when the population of this town increased‚ his son Iulus·
or Ascanius left it to his step-mother, and founded Alba Longa. 'l'o
the spot he was directed by a white sow with a litter of thirty pige,
such a sight as the Trojans had never seen. The highest point of the

Claudius in the year Aa). 42 caused a basin to be dug two miles to
the north, which was connected with the river by means of a canai.
Here ships of large size were able to ride, the basin being protected
by two moles which ran out into the sea, and between them there was
a breakwater with a lighthouse upon it. This basin was called Portus
Augusti. Trajan increased and improved this artificial harbor (which
Juvenal says you would admire more than any naturai one) by the
addition of an inner basin. This basin the pilot of Catullus’s ship
made for. It was such that a small boat might enter and lie there
in safety, such a boat as plied upon the Lacus Lucrinus, by Baiae.
The above account explains the text. ‘ Por-rectaque brachia rursum ’
means that the moles were curved outwards beyond the break-
water and took a bend inwards behind it. ‘ Non sic igitur ’ is ‘not
so much then: such being the character of the work. ‘ Sed ’ means
that though the outer basin was safe, the pilot thought it better with
his disabled ship to go into the other. Gibbon (c. xxxi.) gives an
account of this port, which he calls “ one of the boldest and most
stupeudous works of Roman magnificence.” Juvenal calls the break-
water Tyrrhenam Pharon after the Alexandrian Pharos, on which
Ptolemy Philadelphus built his lighthouse. From this lighthouses in
general got the name Pharos. This allusion to Trajan's basin shows
that the satire was not written before his time.
