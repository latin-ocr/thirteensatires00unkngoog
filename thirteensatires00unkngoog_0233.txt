know them merely by name, and says they only differed by a tunic.
The Cynics were called ὁιπλοεῐματοι from wearing the cloak or rug
which formed their only covering double, that it might serve as a bed
and blanket at night. They wore this rug (abolla) so that the right
shoulder was bare. They were also called familiai-ly ἀχίτωνες, which

for money and disbelief of all honesty, the second from professedly
higher philosophical motives‚ and the third because such vexation aud
all sorts of excitement only interfered needlessly with the enjoyment
of lise. Epicurus opened his school at Athens, 13.c. 306, and taught
there about thirty-six years till his death. ‘ Et' means ‘ even.' ‘ Non ’
(verse 122> stands for ⁸ nec.'

123. Suspicit exigui] ‘ Suspicit' is ‘looks ul} t0,’ and it would seem
that the first meaning of ‘sub' was ‘up.’ ' his is plainly shown in
many compounds. Epicurus, though he advocated animal pleasure,
was an abstemious liver upon principle. and fond of gardening3 and
it was in a gai-(len he bought in the middle of Athens that he taught
all the time he lived there. His successors taught there too, for he
left it to his school.

124. Cur-entur dubii] ‘ Dubii’ means in a critical state. As to the
combination, see on vili. 49. Juvenal says dpatients in a ‹langerous state
may apply to great doctors3 but his frien 's disorder is slight. and he
may trust to the phlebotomy of a pupil of Philippus, who represents
some small or bungling practitioner of the day.

126. Si nullum ἱη terris] ‚Juvenal may or may not have had in mind
Stertinius's words to Damasippus about madness: “hoc si erit in te
Solo, nil verbi pereas quin fortiter addam '’ (Hor. S. ii. 3. 41).

129. claudenda est janua damam] Roman houses were shut when one
of the family died, as with us. Hoc’ (verse 132) does not refer to
the latter clause, but to that which is most prominent in the writer’s
mind; see x. 326. The mourner is not content to tear only the top of
his tunic instead of rending it from top to bottom, and to torment his

J aventu-like digression. ‘ Sed ' is commonly used after digressions.

136. δι’ decies lectis] This is a difficult sentence. ‘Decies ' seems to
be put for any large number of times, and ‘ diversa parte ' to mean in
different parts of the town. The meaning then would be: “ If it often
happens, not here or there, but in various places (in all the fora). that
dehtors, when their acknowledgments are read over to them, say their
bonds are void, and the tables they are written upon are worthless,
though their own writing and their own choicest seal convict them,
do you think yon, my fine gentleman‚ are to be placed beyond the
common pale of suffering ’ἒ ” ‘ chirographa ⁹ and ‘ syngraphae ’ were
used in later times as equivalent words for bonds, notes of hand, or
agreements. ‘ Ligni ’ is the wooden waxed tablets (tabellae) on which
they wrote. The very writing convicted the man, his acknowledg-
