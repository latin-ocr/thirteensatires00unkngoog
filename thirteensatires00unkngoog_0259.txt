sumn xv. 243

5⁷. Dimidios, alias ficies] As to ‘dimidios,' see above, verse 5. It
does not only mean ‘ broken off.’ There is ⁴ dimidium crus ’ (xiii. 95)
for a broken leg. ‘ Alias facies ’ is ⁴ altered faces! On ⁴ aspiceres,'
see A. 60, 2, α, Μ. 350, 8703 Η. 486, 111„ 4; B. 1278. ‘ Ualc'ent'
shows that this is the reason which they would have given.

61. Et sane quo tot rixantis] ⁴⁴ The people think this is only-child's
play, and they are right; for what is the use of such thousands of
fighters if none of them are killed ’ἐ ” There is humor in this. ⁴ Quo'
is used as several times before. See references on viii. 9. ⁴ Minia’ is
accusative, we may supply ⁴ habent ' or ‘ parant! ⁴ Saxa inclinatis
per humum quaesita lacertis ’ expresses the way in which they stoop
to pick up the stones while they keep an eye upon the enemy all the
time. Stones he says are the usual wea ons for sssuabbles where
townspeople fall out among themselves, ‘ ome-stica means such as
they were familiar with. Virgil tells us how Turnus threw a huge rock
at Aeneas. Homer says that Ajax threw a great stone at Hector, and
Diomed, as Juvenal says, hit Aeneas on the hi ‘with a stone that a
couple of men of unheroic days could not lift- omer lived robably
not many generations after the Trojau war. The race of ants was
growing less even in his day (·vivo jam Homero’). But the strong
nien before Troy were nothing to those Nestor kne'w in his youth, and
so it goes on. The past is seen through a mist, and all things gone
must needs be greater and better than the present. But men and things
are much what they have been and always will, be. He says rnen of
this day are both wicked and feeble; so the gods, or whichever of the
gods takes the trouble to look at men, both laugh at them and hate
them. ‘ Quicunque aspexit' is conten.ptuous and Epicurean. The
difference in tense in ‘percussit’ and ⁴ valeant’ explains itself3 the
former is indicative because it declares a fact, the latter is subj unctive
because it belongs to a description. See A. 65, 2; M. 364, obs. 1.

72. A diverticulo repetatur ¹ subulca] ‘⁴ After this digression we may go
back to our story.'' He might have ex ressed this more shortly by
‘ sed ' (verse 38, 51) or ‘ ergo ' (x. 54). ⁴ ars altera' is the Tentyrites,
who with a reinforcement put the Ombites to ssight. It appears
from this place that by Tentyra there was a grove ot' palms, no un-
common thing ; hut this grove was perhaps an uncommon one. ⁴ Hinc ’
is ‘ on this side 3 ' that is, among the fugitives, as the context shows.

82. Aut vertebam] We must supply ‘torruit,' which 5⁸,implied by
zeugma in ‘decoxit. ‘Usque adeo' belongs to both adjectives, ‘so
very tedious and stow!

84. Hic μακάριε libet] “ Here we may rejoice that they did not dese·
crate that fire which Prometheus stole from heaven and gave to earth.
1 congratulate the clement on its escape, and 1 dare say you requce
too.” He is addressing his friend. This element has from the earliest
times been respected as a beneficial agent and as the symbolos the
divine attributes and of the life of man. The Persians worshipped it,
and their descendants the Parsees do so still. But Juvenal is only
writing sarcasticall . ·

87. Sed qui mor-«Le cadaver] ‘ Sed ’ is, as before, a way of carrying
on a subject after a digression. As to ⁴ sustinuit,' see xiv. 127, n.
