61. Ιέηι reddunt iqnes,] He goes on to illustrate his case by the
example of Sejanus. That man was son of Seius Strabo, commander
of the praetoriau troops, which brought him into early intimacy with
Tiberius. From the time that Tiberius beeame emperor Am. 14 till
Aa). 31, Sejanus was his chief favorite and the adviser of some of his
worst crimes. He was ambitione of the imperial power, and his designs
became known to or suspected by Tiberius, who in aa». 31 wrote from,
Capreae such a letter to the Senate concerning Sejanus as to lead to
his execution. His statues were forthwith pulled down, his body was
thrown down the Gemoniae (a precipioe on the Aventine), and torn to
piecoe by the po ulaee, and the remains were dragged about the
streets, and then wn into the Tiber. See Merivale‚ v. 94-238.

63. esc-facie toto orbe secunda] Dion Cassius says that bronze statues
were erected to Sejanus on an equality with Tiberius in every direc-
tion; they were represented in pictures together: gilded chariots were
brought into the theatres in honor of both alike; they were voted
joint oonsuls for five years; it was decreed that they should be met
with equal honors whenever they entered Rome, and sacrifices were
offered Before the images of Sejanus as before those of Tiberius. Out
of the bronze statues of the man so honored, Juvenal says, were made
little j s, basius, kettles, and pans or platters.

65. 1Ἐοηε domi lamma] This decorating the doors with wreaths was
common on joyful occasions. A white ox was the most acceptable
sacrifice, and it appears that the dark parts of the animal, his horus,
hoofs‚ and any spots about him, were whitened with chalk. It was
common for the public executioner to drag the bodies of criminals
through the streets.

67. Quae labra! quis illa People all rejoice at his death, and make

remarks on his diabolical eatures. Yet, while they hate the man, they
tremble at the tyranny by which he perished, without trial or proof of
guilt. ⁶ Index’ is an accomplice turned informer, and ‘indicium' is
the testimony of such an one. ‘ Delator’ is a common informer.

J 71. υετΡὸωα et qrandis epistola] See Met-ivam, v. 225. Tiberius
left Rome Am. 25, and never returned to the city. In the following
year he took up his residence in the island of Capreae (see below, 93,
n.), where he lived six years in almost total retirement, admitting none
but informers and chosen favorites to his presence, but holding con-
stant communication b letter with the Senate.
