mouthed, others had long made up their minds that the man was
imposing on them. ⁸ Aretalogi ’ were jesters employed by the rich to
amuse them at their meals with moe-k philosophical discussions.

1⁷. Hanc abicit,] The use of the tense is like that iu iii. 296, where
see note.

19. Nam citius Scyllam] The speaker says he might perhaps more
readily swallow his stories about the rocks and the winds and his
crew turned to pigs, though these are mere lies (as he implies in verse
17). But did he think the Phaeacians such fools as to believe about
the giants that ate men 21

20. Cyanam] ΙΙ the reading is right, the caesura and two consonante
followin will account for the ⁸ a' being long. See A. ἃ. S. 283, iv„
Bxc. 2, . 3; Β. 1427. The rocks Juvenal means are the Symplegades
at the entrance of the Thracian Bosporus from the Euxine Sea.
But he has confounded these with other rocks in the Sicilian Sea,
which Circe advised Ulysses to avoid. Homer calls them Πλαγκταὶ,
‘the Wanderers,' for the same reason that the others are called
Συμπληγὰὁες, ‘ concurrentia saxa.’ When Ulysses was leaving the
island of Aeolus, the king gave him a leathern bag containing all the
winds. His companions let them out of the bag, and the cons uences
were disastrous. Elpenor was one of the compa-nions of lysseS.
llomer does not tell us that he was one of those whom Circe turned
with a stroke of her light rod into swine; he says Od. x. 552, sqq.)

fabulous place, was identified in after times with Corcyra. ‘ Tenietum ’
is an old word for wine. ‘ Minimum ' is used adverbially.

26. Solus enim lioc Ithacus] His companions had all perished, and he
came alone to the land of the l’haeacians. He sa s Ulysses might
justly be suspected of lying, for he could not prove his story by any
testimony but his own; whereas what he is going to tell was a public
thing that hap ened only the other day.

2¹7. nuper onsule June'ol The consul referred to is either Appius
«Iunius Sabinus in the reign of Domitian, Aa). 84, or, more probably,
Q. Junius Rusticus in the reign of Hadrian, Λα). 119. ⁴ Nuper' does
not fix the time within a few years. The sounding of ‘Junio ' as two
syllables by synizesis is a common license.

28. momia Copti,] Coptos was a town about ten miles north of
Thebes. ‘ Super' means higher up the river.

29. Nos υιιζιιί scelus] He says he is going to tell of an outrage com·
mitted by a whole people‚ and therefore notorious - an outrage worse
than any to be found in all the tragedies since the deluge. He first
represents tragedy by the ‘ cothurnus,’ the thick-soled boot worn by
tra 'c actors, and the ‘ syrma,’ their train (viii. 229, n.). The delnge
of eucalion and Pyrrha is commonly taken for the beginning of
augea( ¹2:32} ¹2:⁸21·oe antiqua simultas,] ‘ Vetus ' means that the quarrel is
