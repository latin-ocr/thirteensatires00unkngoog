magistrate, is meant in a jocular way; for if the aediles at Rome

were reduced so low, those of the country towns were small enough.

190. gelida Praeneste ruinam] Praeneste (Palestrina) was twenty·
three miles east of Rome, on the edge of the Apennines. Virgil and
⁰Horace, and all other writers, use Praeneste iii the neuter gender; but
in Aen. vin. 361 Virgil has “ Praeneste sub ipsa,'' where, as here, it is
feminine. Gabii is re tedly mentioned by Horace as a deserted
town. It lay on the ia Praenestina, midway between Rome and
Praeneste. Juvenal here calls it ‘ sini lices,’ ‘ unsophisticated ; ' but
this was compared with Rome. Vo sinii, which retains its name
under the form of Bolsena‚ was an important city of Etruria, situated
at the foot of the hills above the lake that was called after it. It stood
on ‘the Via Qassia, seyenty-two miles from Rome. Tibur (Tivoli),
which was sixteen miles from Rome, on the banks of the Anio, is
here called ‘ ronum,' and by Horace ⁶ supinum,' because it was situ-
ated on the s ope of a hill. ⁴ Arx ’ was commonly used for a town so
built, though the citadel was gone or had never existed, or for a, hill
on which ¹¹⁰. town was built at all.
