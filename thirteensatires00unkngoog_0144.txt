223. Si potes avelli Ce'roenst'bus‚] The Ludi Circenses, or Magni, took
place annually, and were of the highest antiquity, having been first
celebrated b Romulus, as the tradition went, on the occasion of the

horsemanship such as are witnessed in modern circuses. These were
performed in the Circus Maximus, the vast building erected, according

optima Sorae Ant Fabrateriae] ‘Paratur ’ is opposed to ‘conducis ; Ἀ,
one is ‘ to buy} the other ‘to hire.’ The three towns here mentioned*
were in Latium3 Sora was on the Liris, and still retains its name;
part of the walls also are still in existence. Fabrateria was a town
also on the banks of the Ligis, but about twelve miles lower down, by
the junction of that river and the Trerus. Frusino was situated half-
way between Fabrateria and Ferentf‘num, also on the Via Latina, and
onstthe riffht bank of the Cosa, a tributary of the Trerus. Cicero had

228. culti villicus horst] As to ‘ villicus,' see above, verse 195. Here
the man is his own gardener. PythagoraS, as is well known, forbade
his disciples to eat animal food, on account of his belief in the trans·
mig-ration of souis.

232. sed illum] This is a sort of parenthesis, and meant for another
stroke at town living, where people eat all manner of sood and go to
bed with it undigested. ‘ Scd ’ is commonly so used. Compare M.
437, a. ‘Nam ’ takes up the sentence from ‘ vigilando,' and explains
the reason of that general assertion. ‘ Imperfectus ’ is undigested
and indigestible. ‘Ardenti stomacho ’ is a feverish stomach. Indi-
gcstion brings on the illness‚ and want of slee kills the patient. ‘ Plu-
rimus ’ does not strictly agree with ‘ aeger,' w ich is an adjective. It
isused absolutely; ‘ many a man, bein sick.’ The last syllable in
‘ vigilando' is short by exception. Μ. 9, 4, obs. ; A. 8ο S. 297, R. 2.
‘ Pe rit ' is aorist.
