170. Ut Gyan* clausus scopulis] See i. 73, n. Gyarus and Seriphos
were islands in the Cyclades group, to which criminals were trans·
ported. Seriphus was the larger of the two, and about twelve miles
in circumference.

1¹71. afiyoelals mum‘mm] The city of Babylon is said to have been
built of brick cemented with asphalt by Semiramis. Here Alexander
died, n.c. 323, in his thirty-third year. A ‘sarcophagus' was prop·
erly a coffin composed of a particular stone from Assos in Troas,
which was said to consume the body (σάρκα φαγεῖν).

173. Quantula sint hominum corpuscula] This idea is a favorite one
with the ts. The best-known allusion to it is in Shakespeare’s
HenryIV.P.i. Act v. Sc. 4:

“ Fare thee well, great heart!
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunkl
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough.'’

1⁷4. Vele'ficatm Athos,] To avoid the catastro he that happened to
Mardonius, whose fleet was wrecked there in t e first expedition of
Darius against Greece (n c. 492), Xerxes ordered the low isthmus of
the peninsula (Acte) to be cut through, and a canal was made capable
of floating two triremes abreast. This was in nc. 490. Juvenal treats
the matter as an invention3 but the canal has been recentlv traced.
The ffliom has been noticed before. see A. a s. 274, 2, R. 5; Η.

1⁷5. constratum classibus isdem] This refers to the bridge of boats
across the Hellespont, built of the same ships which sailed through
Athos. Herodotus speaks of several rivers (the scamander in Asia,
,and others in Thrace, Thessaly, and Achaia) being dried up by the
enormous host of Xerxes drinking of them. This is easily explained.
These rivers are not perennial streams full of water. The army could
find water-heles only in many of them, and these they may have
exhausted. Sostratus seems to have been a poet who wrote of the
exploits of Xerxes. ‘Madidis alis ’ is supposed to mean that he got
heated with the exertion of reciting his poetry. This is not a satisfac·
tory explanation, and the words may mean that his flight was not a

wind, as Eurus is the southeast. He flogged whatever wind » opposed
him. This may be a playful invention of Juvenal’s, making Xerxes a
harder master to the winds than Aeolus himself, who was stern encugh
according to Virgil. Xerxes’s castigation and chaining of the Hel-
lespont for breaking down his bridge are told by Aeschylus and
Hergdoltuls‘. Juvenal produces Homer’s epithet for Poseidon, the
