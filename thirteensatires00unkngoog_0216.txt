He says the man who spits out his wine over his marble fioor may like
that sort of language, but plain men, living in their quiet way, do not.

‘ Nitidus’ has reference to manners and may be rendered ‘ well-bred.’
The dice used by the Romans were of two sorts: ‘ tali,' which had
four flat sides, and ⁴ tesserae, tessellae,’ which had six. The former
were made of the knucklebones of animale, chiefly sheep, and an-

is a way of coming to the chief ostensible purpose. When a man can
write to his friend, as in verses 186 ιο 189, whether in joke or in

193. Interea Meqalese'aoae] The Megalesia was a festival kept in
honor of Cybele early in April of each year. Her worship as that of
the great goddess (μεγάλη) was introduced from Mount Ida in Phrygia.
The M egalesian games were not celebrated in the Circus before the

people.' It is most common in the combinatione ‘pace mea,' ‘pace
tua.' He asks their leave to abuse them, for he says in the same
breath they are a huge useless mob‚ and care for nothing but the
Circus, as he has said often before.

the Circus into four parties, who were distinguished by the color of
