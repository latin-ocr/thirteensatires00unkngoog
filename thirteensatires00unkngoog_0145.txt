horses and mules kept standing for want of room at the corners (‘ in·
flexu,' ⁸ turning’) of the crowded and narrow streets. ‘ Mandra'
(μᾶνὸρα) is properly a stable or other place where animals are herded:
here it is applied to the beasts themselves, because they are huddled
together. We have in English the word ‘ archimandrite.'

238. Druso vitulisque marinis] By Drusus some of the commen·
tators suppose is meant the emperor Claudius, whose cognomen was
Drusus, and who is said by Suetonius usually to have gone to sleep
after dinner, and to have been naturally lethargic. It is not impossible
his 'name may have passed into a proverb 2; if not, it is useless to ask
who this Drusus was. Sea-calves are not lively animals in a menagerie,
{herehztssvessa'l had probably seen many ;.for every sort of animal was

roug o me.

239. ,Si meat officium‚] ⁴ Officium ’ is here used for the man's attend-
ance on the great or rich. ‘ Liburno ' would seem to be the ablative
of the means. The rich, during the empire, had horsemen (Numidae)

was the name of an Attic vessel containing about nine gallons, was a
jar for oil or wine, a little larger than an ‘ amphora)

249. quanto celebretur sportula sumo 9] ‘ How the crowded sportula
smokes. ‘ Celebrare ' is ‘ to crowd.’ It contains the same root (creb-
as ‘ creber.’ From this scene it appears that the viands were carrie
away in the asternoon. The word ‘ convivae ’ is used ironically; they
ought to be the great man's guests, and he puts them off with a mess
of meat. ‘ Culina ’ was a portable kitchen in which the provisions were
carried to kee them warm.

25].. Οονὸι vir-ferret} This may be any strong man. The Roman
general Corbulo is described by Tacitus as of large stature, and his
ῐιῖιηεῶηαγ have passed into a proverb in this matter 3 but it is impos-

2⁵4„ [ἔφη coruscat sarraca] ‘ Sarracum ’ was a wagon, and is
apltfliggaellseyvlaere to the constellation of the Great Bear, which we

2⁵⁰7. qui saxa Liquste‘ca portat] Stone from the quarries of Liguria;
that is, from the Maritime Alps. ‘Procubuit ’ and ‘ fudit’ are used
like the Greek aorist.

261„ More animae] ‘ Like a breath.' ‘ Domus ’ is the ‘ familia do-
